# ISOInspector App Manual (Draft)

The ISOInspector SwiftUI application will provide interactive MP4/QuickTime inspection per the product requirements. This draft ties future work to tasks C1–C5 and E1–E4 of the execution workplan.

## Current State
- SwiftUI entry point renders a placeholder welcome view listing the initial focus areas from `ISOInspectorKit`.
- Linux-compatible fallback prints the same welcome summary for developers without SwiftUI.

## Planned Features
1. Document browser and recent files list (E1).
2. Streaming tree and detail panes (C1–C3).
3. Annotation and bookmark persistence (C4).
4. Accessibility compliance and keyboard navigation (C5).
5. Distribution readiness including entitlements and notarization (E4).

Update this manual with screenshots, workflows, and troubleshooting notes as features land.
