## Motivation and Context

The FoundationUI framework requires a clear implementation roadmap to:

1. **Guide Development**: Provide a structured, phase-by-phase approach
2. **Ensure Quality**: Establish comprehensive testing from the start
3. **Track Progress**: Enable transparent progress tracking with checkboxes
4. **Maintain Standards**: Enforce design system consistency and accessibility
5. **Support Collaboration**: Clear priorities and file paths for team coordination

This task plan is derived directly from the **FoundationUI PRD v1.0** and implements the Composable Clarity design system across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS platforms.

## Dependencies

### Required Before Implementation
- [ ] Swift 5.9+ toolchain
- [ ] Xcode 15.0+ installed

### External Tools (for testing)
- [ ] SwiftLint
- [ ] swift-snapshot-testing framework
- [ ] AccessibilitySnapshot framework
