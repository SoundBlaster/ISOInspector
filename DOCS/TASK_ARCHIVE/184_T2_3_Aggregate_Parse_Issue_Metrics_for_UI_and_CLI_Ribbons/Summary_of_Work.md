# Summary of Work — 2025-10-27

## Completed Tasks
- **T2.3 — Aggregate Parse Issue Metrics for UI and CLI Ribbons**
  - Extended `ParseIssueStore` with `metricsSnapshot()` and `makeIssueSummary()` so SwiftUI ribbons and CLI flows can fetch per-severity counts, totals, and deepest affected depth without recomputing the store.
  - Updated tolerant parsing documentation (`DOCS/AI/Tolerance_Parsing/TODO.md`, `IntegrationSummary.md`, and execution workplan) to reference the new aggregation APIs.
  - Added test coverage in `ParseIssueStoreTests` for severity dictionaries, background snapshots, and summary DTOs.

## Verification
- `swift test --filter ParseIssueStoreTests`
- `swift test`

## Follow-Up
- `@todo PDD:45m` in `Sources/ISOInspectorApp/State/ParseTreeStore.swift` remains open to surface the new metrics in SwiftUI once ribbon specs land.
