# Next Tasks

- üöÄ **T2.3 ‚Äî Aggregate Parse Issue Metrics for UI and CLI Ribbons** _(In Progress)_:
  - Extend `ParseIssueStore` aggregation to expose per-severity counts for tolerant parsing dashboards and streaming summaries.
  - Coordinate with design deliverables noted in `DOCS/AI/ISOInspector_Execution_Guide/04_TODO_Workplan.md` to confirm ribbon layout requirements and unblock downstream UI wiring.
- üöß **VoiceOver Regression Pass for Accessibility Shortcuts** _(Blocked ‚Äî pending hardware)_:
  - Schedule macOS and iPadOS hardware verification to confirm focus command menus announce controls and restore focus targets. Reference `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/156_G8_VoiceOver_Regression_Pass_for_Accessibility_Shortcuts/`.
- ‚è≥ **Real-World Assets** _(Blocked ‚Äî awaiting licensing approvals)_:
  - Secure Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H fixtures so regression baselines can shift from synthetic payloads once approvals land.
- üé® **Tolerant Parsing ‚Äî Surface Issue Metrics in SwiftUI** _(Pending design sign-off)_:
  - Surface `ParseIssueStore` metrics in SwiftUI ribbons once tolerant parsing UI specs are finalized. Track via `@todo PDD:45m` in `Sources/ISOInspectorApp/State/ParseTreeStore.swift` and the open item in `todo.md`.
