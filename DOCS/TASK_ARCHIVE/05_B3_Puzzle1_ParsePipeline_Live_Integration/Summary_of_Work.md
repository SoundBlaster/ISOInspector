# Summary of Work

## Completed Tasks

- **Puzzle #1 â€” Wire `ParsePipeline.live()` to the streaming walker:** Implemented the concrete `StreamingBoxWalker`, refactored `ParsePipeline.live()` to drive it, and added dedicated unit tests covering nested traversal, large boxes, error propagation, and cancellation semantics.

## Test Evidence

- `swift test`

## Documentation Updates

- Marked Puzzle #1 as complete in `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md` and the archived checklist.

## Follow-Up Notes

- Proceed to downstream parser tasks (e.g., B4 catalog integration) now that live streaming events are emitted from real
  walker logic.
