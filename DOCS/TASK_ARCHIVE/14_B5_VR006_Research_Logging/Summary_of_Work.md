# Summary of Work â€” VR-006 Research Logging

## Completed Tasks

- Implemented persistent VR-006 research logging with deduplicated JSON storage shared by CLI and UI consumers.
- Added configurable research log handling to the CLI with `--research-log` option and default location announcement.
- Updated documentation trackers and TODOs to note VR-006 logging availability for analysts.

## Key Changes

- Added `ResearchLogEntry`/`ResearchLogWriter` infrastructure and extended `ParsePipeline` to record unknown boxes using contextual metadata.
- Enhanced CLI environment to provision research log writers, parse the `--research-log` flag, and surface the log path before streaming events.
- Expanded test coverage for research logging across kit and CLI layers.

## Validation

- `swift test`

## Follow-ups

- Monitor research log schema usage once UI components evolve beyond the current scaffold.
