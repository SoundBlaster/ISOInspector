# Summary of Work — 2025-10-24

## Completed Tasks
- **T1.4 BoxHeaderDecoder Result Refactor** — Transitioned the header decoder to a result-based API so tolerant parsing flows can capture malformed header diagnostics without halting iteration.

## Implementation Highlights
- Introduced a `Result<BoxHeader, BoxHeaderDecodingError>` return signature for `BoxHeaderDecoder.readHeader(…)` and preserved a deprecated strict convenience wrapper for legacy callers.
- Refactored the decoder internals into a shared implementation that now populates `Result` values rather than throwing, ensuring error typing remains focused on `BoxHeaderDecodingError` cases.
- Updated `StreamingBoxWalker` and unit tests to adopt the new API surface, propagating failures explicitly and validating both success and failure scenarios across existing coverage.

## Verification
- `swift test`

## Follow-ups
- Proceed with **T1.5** to teach container iteration to translate decoder failures into `ParseIssue` records and continue traversal in tolerant mode.
