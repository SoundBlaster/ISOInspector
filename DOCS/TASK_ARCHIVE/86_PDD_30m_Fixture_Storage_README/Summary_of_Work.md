# Summary of Work — Fixture Storage README

## Completed Tasks

- Authored `Documentation/FixtureCatalog/README.md` outlining storage quotas, mount strategies, and cache maintenance steps for manifest-driven fixture downloads on macOS hardware runners and Linux CI agents.【F:Documentation/FixtureCatalog/README.md†L1-L108】
- Archived the in-progress specification and marked the corresponding puzzle as completed in `todo.md`, keeping PDD tracking in sync.【F:todo.md†L38-L39】

## Validation

- `python3 Tests/ISOInspectorKitTests/Fixtures/generate_fixtures.py --skip-text-fixtures --manifest Documentation/FixtureCatalog/manifest.json --dry-run` *(documentation reference; no fixture downloads executed during this task).*【F:Documentation/FixtureCatalog/README.md†L55-L67】

## Follow-Up

- Monitor macOS runner provisioning; once hardware lands, integrate the sparse bundle setup commands into the automation scripts or CI workflows to guarantee the mount precedes fixture sync.
- Revisit the README after expanding the manifest beyond the initial Blender sample to ensure quotas stay accurate.
