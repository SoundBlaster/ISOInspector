# Next Tasks After C2

- [ ] Wire the explorer to real file selection and trigger `ParseTreeStore.start` so snapshots stream from user data.
- [ ] Implement additional outline filters for box categories and streaming metadata (see `@todo #6`).
- [ ] Expose selection bindings that feed upcoming C3 detail and hex panes.
