# Summary of Work â€” C2 Tree View Virtualization & Search

## âœ… Deliverables

- Authored a `ParseTreeOutlineViewModel` that virtualizes `ParseTreeSnapshot` hierarchies, supports incremental expansion state, and applies search/filter constraints while remaining `@MainActor` for SwiftUI updates.
- Added SwiftUI explorer components (`ParseTreeExplorerView`, `ParseTreeOutlineView`, and row badges) that render large parse trees with `LazyVStack`, provide severity toggles, and surface parse state feedback.
- Seeded reusable preview data to exercise the outline without a live parse pipeline and wired the macOS app scene to host the explorer by default.
- Captured unit coverage around expansion, search auto-expansion, and severity filtering behavior in `ParseTreeOutlineViewModelTests`.

## ðŸ§ª Validation

- `swift test` (Linux) exercising 81 package tests including the new outline view-model cases.

## ðŸ”œ Follow-ups

- Extend the outline filter system to include box category and streaming metadata toggles once upstream models land (`@todo #6`).
- Connect the explorer to file import workflows so Combine snapshots stream from real parses instead of preview data.
