# Summary of Work

- **E2 â€” Integrate Parser Event Pipeline with UI Components**
  - Auto-select the first parsed node so the detail pane populates as soon as streaming events arrive. See `2025-10-12-parser-selection-bridging.md` for micro PRD context.
  - Tests: `ParseTreeOutlineViewModelTests` now verify default selection and identifier tracking for updated snapshots.
  - Follow-up: add macOS SwiftUI automation once available to cover end-to-end selection updates.
