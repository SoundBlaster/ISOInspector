# Next Tasks

- **Completed:** Task D3 â€” `traf/tfhd/tfdt/trun` fragment run parsing, validation, and export wiring landed. Delivery details captured in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/137_D3_traf_tfhd_tfdt_trun_Parsing/Summary_of_Work.md`.
- **Follow-Up (Archived):** Fragment coverage expansion with multi-`trun`, negative `data_offset`, composition offset, and missing `tfdt` fixtures now lives in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/138_Fragment_Fixture_Coverage/Fragment_Fixture_Coverage.md` with verification details in `Summary_of_Work.md`.
- **Next Puzzle Intake:** Evaluate downstream validator and CLI polish tasks that consume the new fragment summaries, then queue them for execution once additional DASH/HLS fixtures arrive.
- **Pending Licensing:** Acquire real-world fixtures for Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H codecs so synthetic payloads can be replaced and snapshot baselines refreshed once licensing clears. (Tracked in `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md`.)
