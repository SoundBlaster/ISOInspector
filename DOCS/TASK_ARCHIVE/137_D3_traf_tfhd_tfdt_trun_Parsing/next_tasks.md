# Next Tasks

- **Completed:** Task D3 â€” `traf/tfhd/tfdt/trun` fragment run parsing, validation, and export wiring landed. Delivery details captured in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/137_D3_traf_tfhd_tfdt_trun_Parsing/Summary_of_Work.md`.
- **Follow-Up (In Progress):** Expand fragment coverage with multi-`trun` fixtures, negative `data_offset`/composition offset edge cases, and fragments missing `tfdt` to exercise defaulting paths before promoting to production fixtures. (See `DOCS/INPROGRESS/Fragment_Fixture_Coverage.md`.)
- **Next Puzzle Intake:** Evaluate downstream validator and CLI polish tasks that consume the new fragment summaries, then queue them for execution once additional DASH/HLS fixtures arrive.
- **Pending Licensing:** Acquire real-world fixtures for Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H codecs so synthetic payloads can be replaced and snapshot baselines refreshed once licensing clears.
