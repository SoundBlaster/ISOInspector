# Summary of Work

## 2025-10-18 — FullBoxReader Utility

### Completed Tasks — FullBoxReader Utility

- **B5 — FullBoxReader Utility**
  - Added `FullBoxReader` and `FullBoxHeaderFields` to centralize `(version, flags)` decoding for ISO full boxes.
  - Covered success, truncation, and error propagation scenarios with `FullBoxReaderTests`.
  - Refactored `mvhd` and `tkhd` parsers to use the helper, keeping payload extraction intact while removing duplicated offsets.

### Implementation Notes — FullBoxReader Utility

- The helper validates that at least four payload bytes are available before decoding and exposes a `contentRange` so callers can continue parsing box-specific fields.
- Existing parsing helpers (`readUInt32`, `readUInt64`, etc.) remain in place; `FullBoxReader` composes them via `RandomAccessReader` to stay testable.
- Downstream call sites now rely on `contentStart` rather than recomputing `payloadRange.lowerBound + 4`, reducing manual index arithmetic.

### Verification — FullBoxReader Utility

- `swift test`

### Follow-Up — FullBoxReader Utility

- Extend `FullBoxReader` adoption to additional full boxes (e.g., `mdhd`, `hdlr`) when their parsers are implemented.

## 2025-10-17 — App Icon Rasterization

### Completed Tasks — App Icon Rasterization

- **I3 — App Icon Rasterization**
  - Automated PNG generation for every AppIcon idiom/scale via `scripts/generate_app_icon.py`.
  - Updated `AppIcon.appiconset/Contents.json` with deterministic filenames consumed by the new automation.
  - Added `AppIconAssetTests` to enforce that each manifest entry tracks the generator's filename convention.

### Implementation Notes — App Icon Rasterization

- The generator renders a 1024×1024 master icon using the brand palette defined in `ISOInspectorBrandPalette.production` and resizes it for each required slot.
- Generated assets live in `Sources/ISOInspectorApp/Resources/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/` after running the script; PNG outputs are `.gitignore`d and should be regenerated locally before packaging builds.
- `todo.md` and `ISOInspectorAppTheme.swift` no longer carry the PDD placeholder for icon work.
- The Python workflow depends on Pillow (`pip install pillow`) to render the gradients and icon geometry.

### Verification — App Icon Rasterization

- `swift test`

### Follow-Up — App Icon Rasterization

- Ensure release automation invokes `scripts/generate_app_icon.py` so notarized builds include the regenerated PNGs.
