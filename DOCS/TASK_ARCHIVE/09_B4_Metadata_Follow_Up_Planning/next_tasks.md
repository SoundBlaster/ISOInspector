# Next Tasks

- [x] Outline the additional downstream parser follow-ups now unlocked by real-time streaming events (e.g., catalog

  integration test coverage and fallback handling) in `09_B4_Metadata_Follow_Up_Planning.md`.

- [x] Wire the console formatter into an `inspect` command so validation summaries appear in the CLI pipeline.
- [x] Implement VR-003 metadata comparison rule so CLI and validation pipelines emit catalog-driven warnings.
