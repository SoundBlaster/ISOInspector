# Summary of Work — 2025-10-20

## Completed Tasks

- ✅ **Validation Rule #15** — Correlate `stsc`, `stsz/stz2`, and `stco/co64` tables to surface mismatched sample counts and non-monotonic chunk offsets. (Tracked previously in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/130_VR15_Sample_Table_Correlation/Validation_Rule_15_Sample_Table_Correlation.md` and `todo.md` task #15.)

## Implementation Highlights

- Added `SampleTableCorrelationRule` to `BoxValidator` to reconcile chunk runs, sample sizes, and chunk offsets, emitting VR-015 diagnostics when totals diverge or offsets regress.
- Introduced regression coverage in `ParsePipelineLiveTests` for aligned tables, sample count mismatches, and non-monotonic chunk offsets.
- Removed the lingering `@todo #15` placeholder from the validator default rules.

## Documentation & Tracking Updates

- Marked task #15 complete in `todo.md`, the refreshed `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md` placeholder, and all dependent `next_tasks.md` trackers under `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE`.
- Updated `DOCS/AI/ISOViewer/ISOInspector_PRD_TODO.md` to reflect VR-015 completion and pointed stakeholders to this summary.
- Captured the final outcome directly in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/130_VR15_Sample_Table_Correlation/Validation_Rule_15_Sample_Table_Correlation.md`.

## Verification

- `swift test` (all targets) — confirms VR-015 diagnostics and new regression coverage pass on Linux.

## Follow-Up

- None at this time; downstream CLI/UI correlation already piggybacks on the updated validator.
