# Next Tasks

- üöß **D6 ‚Äî Sample Encryption Placeholder Parsing** _(In Progress)_: Recognize `senc`, `saio`, and `saiz` boxes during fragment parsing so the pipeline records their offsets/sizes and surfaces presence to CLI/UI consumers without attempting decryption. Context lives in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/141_Summary_of_Work_2025-10-21_Sample_Encryption/D6_Recognize_senc_saio_saiz_Placeholders.md`.
- ‚úÖ **E1 ‚Äî Enforce Parent Containment and Non-Overlap** _(Completed ‚Äî see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/159_E1_Enforce_Parent_Containment_and_Non_Overlap/Summary_of_Work.md` for implementation recap.)_: Extended structural validation so child boxes cannot exceed parent ranges, flagging overlapping payloads for CLI/UI surfaces. Planning notes remain in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/141_Summary_of_Work_2025-10-21_Sample_Encryption/E1_Enforce_Parent_Containment_and_Non_Overlap.md`.
- ‚úÖ **D7 ‚Äî Validation Preset CLI Wiring** _(Completed)_: Global flags now surface presets, aliases, and per-rule overrides across all commands, with metadata printing and JSON embedding documented in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/148_D7_Validation_Preset_CLI_Wiring/Summary_of_Work.md`. Planning details remain in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/148_D7_Validation_Preset_CLI_Wiring/D7_Validation_Preset_CLI_Wiring.md` for reference.
- ‚úÖ **Validation Export Metadata Enhancements** _(Resolved by D7)_: CLI commands now print preset metadata, JSON exports embed the active preset and disabled rule IDs, and batch summaries filter disabled rules. Future enhancements can build on the finalized wiring documented in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/148_D7_Validation_Preset_CLI_Wiring/Summary_of_Work.md`.
- ‚è≥ **Real-World Assets** _(Blocked ‚Äî awaiting external licensing approvals)_: Secure licensing for Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H fixtures so synthetic payloads can be replaced and regression baselines refreshed once approvals land.
- ‚úÖ **Codec Validation Coverage Expansion** _(Completed ‚Äî see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/149_Codec_Validation_Coverage_Expansion/Summary_of_Work.md` for end-to-end coverage details.)_
