# Next Tasks

## üî≠ Benchmark Validation

- [ ] Execute the random slice benchmark suite on macOS hardware once Combine support is available so we can compare mapped vs. chunked readers under identical workloads. **(Blocked ‚Äî requires macOS runner with Combine; see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/64_A5_Random_Slice_Benchmarking/Summary_of_Work.md` and `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/65_Summary_of_Work_2025-10-15_Benchmark/2025-10-15-random-slice-benchmark.md`.)**

## üß™ Streaming UI Coverage

- [ ] Run `ParseTreeStreamingSelectionAutomationTests` on macOS hardware with XCTest UI support to validate the end-to-end SwiftUI automation flow introduced in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/48_macOS_SwiftUI_Automation_Streaming_Default_Selection/48_macOS_SwiftUI_Automation_Streaming_Default_Selection.md`. **(Blocked ‚Äî macOS UI testing entitlements unavailable in container; see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/50_Summary_of_Work_2025-02-16/51_ParseTreeStreamingSelectionAutomation_macOS_Run.md`.)**

## üî¨ Combine UI Benchmark Follow-Up

- [ ] Execute the Combine-backed UI benchmark on macOS to capture latency metrics on a platform that ships Combine, keeping throughput parity with the CLI harness. **(Blocked ‚Äî requires macOS runner with Xcode/Combine; see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/50_Summary_of_Work_2025-02-16/50_Combine_UI_Benchmark_macOS_Run.md`.)**
  - Latest container attempt (`2025-10-12`) confirmed XCTest skips the scenario on Linux because `Combine` is unavailable; macOS hardware run still required. See `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/47_Combine_UI_Benchmark_macOS/Summary_of_Work.md` for details.

## üõ†Ô∏è Session Persistence Follow-Ups

- [ ] Reconcile CoreData session bookmark diffs with live bookmark entities when reconciliation rules are defined. See `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/52_E3_Session_Persistence/Summary_of_Work.md`.

## üì¶ Distribution Follow-Up

- [x] Track outcome of the notarized build Apple Events automation assessment alongside `todo.md` entry ‚ÄúPDD:30m Evaluate whether automation via Apple Events is required for notarized builds and extend entitlements safely.‚Äù Reference the final decision in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/57_Distribution_Apple_Events_Notarization_Assessment/57_Distribution_Apple_Events_Notarization_Assessment.md`.

## üì± Filesystem Access Integration

- [x] Provide UIDocumentPicker integration for iOS/iPadOS once UIKit adapters are introduced. **(Completed ‚Äî

  FilesystemAccess.live now routes to the UIKit adapter.)**
