# G6 â€” Export JSON Actions

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Enable ISOInspector to export the parsed box tree as JSONâ€”either the entire document or a selected subtreeâ€”directly from
the app UI while reusing the existing streaming exporters.

## ðŸ§© Context

- The execution workplan calls for Task G6 to bring JSON export controls into the SwiftUI surface now that the tree,

  detail, and hex panes are stable.

- `ISOInspector_PRD_TODO.md` lists export actions as the remaining UI deliverable alongside existing search, filter, and detail functionality.
- CLI commands already emit JSON via `ISOInspectorKit` exporters; the app lacks equivalent actions for parity with the PRD.

## âœ… Success Criteria

- Provide explicit export affordances (menu command + toolbar or context menu) for full document and selected subtree

  JSON captures.

- Wire the UI actions to the existing exporter pipeline so generated files match the CLI schema, including offsets,

  sizes, and metadata fields.

- Persist exported files to a user-chosen location via FilesystemAccessKit with proper sandbox-scoped bookmarks and

  error handling.

- Cover the feature with unit or UI tests that validate command availability and the structure of produced JSON for

  representative fixtures.

- Update user-facing documentation or release notes if new UI elements are introduced.

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Notes

- Extend `ISOInspectorApp` scene commands and document toolbar with export options that invoke the JSON exporter APIs from `ISOInspectorKit`.
- Reuse existing document/session view models to scope exports (root vs. current selection) and ensure operations remain

  responsive by leveraging async tasks.

- Integrate with FilesystemAccessKit save flows to present destination pickers on macOS/iPadOS/iOS and record bookmarks

  where required.

- Coordinate with telemetry/logging to record export attempts and failures, following the zero-trust logging conventions

  already in place.
