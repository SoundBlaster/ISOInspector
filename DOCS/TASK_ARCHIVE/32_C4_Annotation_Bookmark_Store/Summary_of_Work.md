# Summary of Work

## Completed tasks

- Bootstrapped C4 annotation/bookmark persistence with a file-backed store and regression tests.

## Implementation details

- Added JSON-backed `FileBackedAnnotationBookmarkStore` with models for annotations and bookmarks. Tests cover create/update/delete/bookmark flows.
- Introduced `AnnotationBookmarkStoreTests` verifying persistence across instances.
- Added `@todo #10` for migrating to the final CoreData storage layer once research gap R6 lands.

## References

- Tests: `swift test`
- Micro PRD: `DOCS/INPROGRESS/2025-10-10-annotation-bookmark-store.md`

## Pending follow-ups

- (Resolved 2025-10-10) Implement CoreData storage and wire the store into SwiftUI view models once persistence strategy is
  settled. See `DOCS/INPROGRESS/C4_CoreData_Annotation_Persistence.md` for the CoreData migration summary and remaining UI work.
