# Next Tasks â€” DocC Catalog Follow-ups

- [ ] Expand CLI and App DocC catalogs with end-to-end tutorials and screenshots once the UI and command surfaces gain

  additional features.

- [x] Layer DocC publishing into CI (e.g., GitHub Actions artifact upload) after validating storage and hosting

  requirements. (Implemented by the GitHub Actions `docc-archives` job that uploads DocC bundles on every run.)
