# Next Tasks

- ✅ **T2.1 ParseIssueStore Aggregation** _(Completed — see `Summary_of_Work.md`)_:
  - Shared aggregation store, metrics, and tests landed across ISOInspectorKit, CLI, and SwiftUI scaffolding.
- 🔄 **T2.2 Issue Metrics Presentation** _(Follow-up)_:
  - Surface `ParseIssueStore` metrics in SwiftUI ribbons and CLI summaries once the UI spec lands. Track via `@todo PDD:45m` in `ParseTreeStore.swift` and `todo.md`.
- 🚧 **VoiceOver Regression Pass for Accessibility Shortcuts** _(Blocked — pending hardware)_:
  - Schedule macOS and iPadOS hardware verification to confirm focus command menus announce controls and restore focus targets. Reference `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/156_G8_VoiceOver_Regression_Pass_for_Accessibility_Shortcuts/`.
- ⏳ **Real-World Assets** _(Blocked — awaiting licensing approvals)_:
  - Secure Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H fixtures so regression baselines can shift from synthetic payloads once approvals land.
