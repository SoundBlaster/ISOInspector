# Summary of Work â€” T3.3 Integrity Detail Pane

## Completed
- Added a dedicated Corruption section to the SwiftUI detail inspector so tolerant parsing issues surface with severity iconography, copy-friendly metadata, and VoiceOver-ready labels.
- Introduced `ParseTreeDetailViewModel.focusIssue(on:)` to jump the hex viewer to corruption ranges and updated hex slice windowing to center on requested offsets.
- Extended accessibility summaries to report corruption counts and added unit coverage for the new hex navigation workflow.

## Verification
- `swift test`

## Follow-Up Notes
- Coordinate with T3.4 placeholder nodes once design settles so the corruption section can link into placeholder affordances when missing children trigger tolerant parsing issues.
- Audit hex slice window sizing against large offset issues after expanding tolerant parsing fixtures beyond the current payload window size.
