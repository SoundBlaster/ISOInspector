# Summary of Work — 2025-10-19

## Completed Tasks

- **C6 — Implement `stsd` sample description parser**
  - Added a full-box parser to `BoxParserRegistry` that enumerates each sample entry, records entry byte lengths, and captures shared header fields such as the data reference index.
  - Recognized baseline visual (`avc1`, `hvc1`, `hev1`) and audio (`mp4a`) sample entry types so width/height or channel configuration and sample rate metadata are exposed for downstream consumers.
  - Introduced dedicated unit coverage (`StsdSampleDescriptionParserTests`) building representative `avc1` and `mp4a` fixtures to validate parsed metadata against ISO/IEC 14496-12 layout expectations.

## Documentation Updates

- Marked task C6 as completed in `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md`.
- Captured this execution summary in `DOCS/INPROGRESS/Summary_of_Work.md`.

## Verification

- `swift test --filter StsdSampleDescriptionParserTests`
- `swift test`

## Pending Follow-Ups

- [ ] Extend the parser with additional codec-specific field extraction (e.g., `avcC`, `hvcC`, and encrypted variants) as future tasks define the required metadata surface.
