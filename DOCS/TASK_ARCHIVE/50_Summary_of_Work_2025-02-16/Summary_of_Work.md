# Summary of Work â€” 2025-02-16

## Tasks Reviewed

1. **50_Combine_UI_Benchmark_macOS_Run**
   - Confirmed the benchmark harness still requires macOS-only Combine frameworks and Xcode tooling.
   - No execution performed in the Linux container; awaiting scheduling on physical or CI macOS hardware.
1. **51_ParseTreeStreamingSelectionAutomation_macOS_Run**
   - Verified automation prerequisites (XCTest UI + SwiftUI accessibility permissions) remain unavailable in the

     container.

   - Test run blocked until a macOS runner with UI testing entitlements is provisioned.

## Follow-Up Actions

- Secure macOS hardware or CI capacity capable of running both the Combine benchmark and the SwiftUI automation suite.
- Once hardware access is confirmed, execute the pending scenarios, archive the resulting metrics or xcresult bundles,

  and update the relevant task archives and backlog entries.

- Keep `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md` aligned with the blocked status so future runs prioritize hardware allocation.
