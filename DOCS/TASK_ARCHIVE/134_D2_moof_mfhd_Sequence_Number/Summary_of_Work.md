# Summary of Work â€” D2 `moof/mfhd` Sequence Number Parser

## Outcome

- Implemented `moof` fragment support in `BoxParserRegistry` with a dedicated `MovieFragmentHeaderBox` payload so fragment sequence numbers surface through the streaming pipeline, JSON export, and CLI formatting layers.
- Added validation ensuring each fragment header declares a sequence number and that sequence numbers increase monotonically across fragments, emitting warnings when gaps or regressions occur.
- Updated tests and fixtures (parser unit tests, live pipeline coverage, validator expectations, CLI formatter assertions, and DASH snapshot JSON) to confirm the new metadata is emitted end-to-end.

## Validation

- `swift test`

## Follow-Ups

- Add multi-fragment fixtures to exercise validation against longer fragment sequences and capture monotonic enforcement in integration snapshots.
