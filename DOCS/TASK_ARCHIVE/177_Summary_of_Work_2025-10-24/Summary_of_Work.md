# Summary of Work — 2025-10-24

## Completed Tasks
- **B2+ — AsyncSequence Event Stream Integration** (archived in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/176_B2_Plus_AsyncSequence_Event_Stream/`)
  - Rewired `ParseTreeStore` to iterate `ParsePipeline.events(for:context:)` directly with Swift concurrency.
  - Removed the Combine-only `ParsePipelineEventBridge` and updated Xcode project sources.
  - Refreshed app and performance tests to validate async streaming without the bridge.

## Verification
- `swift test`

## Follow-ups
- Surface tolerant parsing metrics in SwiftUI once ribbon specs land (`@todo PDD:45m` in `ParseTreeStore.swift`).
