# Summary of Work — 2025-10-10

## Completed Tasks

- **D3 — CLI Export Commands**: Implemented `export-json` and `export-capture` subcommands in ISOInspectorCLI with deterministic exporters and dedicated tests.

## Implementation Highlights

- Added CLI argument parsing, output validation, and streaming integration to feed `ParseTreeBuilder`, `JSONParseTreeExporter`, and `ParseEventCaptureEncoder` for JSON and binary outputs.
- Updated CLI help text and success/error messaging to document the new export commands and surface failures via stderr.
- Authored new CLI tests covering help output, default destination derivation, exporter round-tripping, and capture decoding using `ParseEventCaptureDecoder`.
- Archived related planning materials and synchronized cross-references (`todo.md`, execution workplan, and prior B6 follow-up notes) to reflect completion of puzzle #9.

## Verification

- `swift test`

## Follow-Up

- None — export command implementation completes puzzle #9.
