# Summary of Work — 2025-10-19

## Completed Tasks

- **C3 — tkhd Track Header Parser**
  - Implemented full `tkhd` payload parsing, including versioned timestamps, derived flag states, transformation matrices, and presentation dimensions inside `BoxParserRegistry.trackHeader`.
  - Added `ParsedBoxPayload.TrackHeaderBox` detail plus JSON export support so UI and export surfaces receive structured track metadata, and refreshed baseline fixtures accordingly.
  - Expanded regression coverage with synthetic version 0/1 cases, disabled-track handling, and baseline fixture
    assertions; regenerated JSON snapshots to capture the enriched output.

## Verification

- `swift test`
- `swift test --filter JSONExportSnapshotTests`

## Pending Follow-Ups

- _None._
