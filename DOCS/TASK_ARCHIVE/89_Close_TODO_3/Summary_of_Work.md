# Summary of Work — Task 89 Close TODO #3

## ✅ Completed

- Audited validation rule coverage for VR-001 through VR-005 using the existing `BoxValidator` implementation and associated unit/integration tests to confirm backlog item `todo.md #3` no longer represents outstanding code work.【F:Sources/ISOInspectorKit/Validation/BoxValidator.swift†L1-L210】【F:Tests/ISOInspectorKitTests/BoxValidatorTests.swift†L1-L130】
- Updated `todo.md` to mark task `#3` complete and preserved rule-specific archival references so the backlog accurately reflects repository state.【F:todo.md†L5-L15】
- Refreshed `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md` to record the backlog reconciliation, clearing the placeholder that previously asked contributors to pick a puzzle without context.【F:DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md†L1-L13】

## 📄 Artifacts

- `todo.md` (validation backlog close-out)
- `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md` (placeholder removal)
- `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/100_Summary_of_Work_2025-10-19_ftyp_Follow_Up/Summary_of_Work.md` (rolling log updated with this task)
