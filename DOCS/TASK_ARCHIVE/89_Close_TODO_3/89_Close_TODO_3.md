# 89 — Close TODO #3 Validation Rules Backlog Entry

## 🎯 Objective

Confirm that backlog item `todo.md #3` is fully satisfied by existing VR-001 through VR-005 implementations and update the project trackers accordingly so the remaining TODO list reflects current reality.

## 🧩 Context

- The root backlog still lists task `#3` as incomplete even though all sub-tasks for VR-001 through VR-005 reference completed archive notes and implemented code paths.【F:todo.md†L5-L15】
- VR ordering and structural rules were delivered across archived tasks `12_B5_VR001_VR002_Structural_Validation` and `13_B5_VR004_VR005_Ordering_Validation`, both of which document code-level validation behavior now present in the repository.【F:DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/12_B5_VR001_VR002_Structural_Validation/Summary_of_Work.md†L3-L15】【F:DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/13_B5_VR004_VR005_Ordering_Validation/Summary_of_Work.md†L7-L14】
- Maintaining accurate tracker status is required by the PDD loop before moving on to new puzzles and ensures downstream planning artifacts (`next_tasks.md`, `ISOInspector_Execution_Guide`) stay aligned.【F:DOCS/COMMANDS/START.md†L73-L90】

## ✅ Success Criteria

- `todo.md #3` is marked complete and references remain intact for each VR rule.
- `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md` no longer lists an unassigned placeholder that simply points back to the backlog entry.
- New summary notes describe the close-out so future contributors see the reconciliation work in the PDD archive and the rolling `Summary_of_Work.md`.

## 🔧 Implementation Notes

- Audit existing code/tests in `Sources/ISOInspectorKit/Validation/` and `Tests/ISOInspectorKitTests/` to confirm VR-001—VR-005 coverage before updating trackers.
- After updating tracker Markdown, run `scripts/fix_markdown.py` against the touched files to keep formatting normalized.
- Archive this puzzle and capture a short summary once the backlog is synchronized.
