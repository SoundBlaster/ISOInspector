# Summary of Work

## Completed

- **F2 — Configure performance benchmarks for large files**
  - Added `PerformanceBenchmarkConfiguration` with environment-tunable payload sizes, iteration counts, and slack multipliers scaled from NFR throughput targets.
  - Introduced `LargeFileBenchmarkTests` exercising CLI validation throughput and, when Combine is available, SwiftUI bridge latency via XCTest metrics harnesses and a reusable large-fixture generator.
  - Updated PRD TODO trackers to mark F2 complete and describe the new automated benchmarks.

## Verification

- `swift test` — Executes the full test suite including the new performance benchmarks (UI latency benchmark skips automatically when Combine is unavailable).

## Follow-up

- Execute the Combine-backed UI benchmark on macOS to capture latency metrics on a platform that ships Combine. **(In Progress
  — see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/47_Combine_UI_Benchmark_macOS/47_Combine_UI_Benchmark_macOS.md`)**
