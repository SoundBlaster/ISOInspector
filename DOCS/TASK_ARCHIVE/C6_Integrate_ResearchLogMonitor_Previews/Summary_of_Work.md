# C6 — Integrate ResearchLogMonitor Audit Results into SwiftUI Previews — Summary of Work

## Completed
- Confirmed `ResearchLogPreviewProvider` snapshots continue to execute `ResearchLogMonitor.audit` against VR-006 fixtures, wiring diagnostics into `ResearchLogAuditPreview` preview states.
- Expanded `ResearchLogAccessibilityIdentifierTests` to assert missing fixture and schema mismatch states expose NestedA11yIDs identifiers, covering the preview-only audit flows.
- Updated DocC guidance and PRD trackers to highlight the SwiftUI preview audit workflow and mark the C6 task complete across execution dashboards.

## Tests
- `swift test`

## Follow-Ups
- None — VR-006 preview diagnostics now surface schema drift and missing fixture issues during SwiftUI preview rendering.
