# Summary of Work â€” 2025-10-15

## âœ… Completed Tasks

- **A4 â€” RandomAccessReader Error Types**: Standardised the random-access reader error surface using the new `RandomAccessReaderError` taxonomy and propagated it through kit readers and fixtures.

## ðŸ›  Implementation Highlights

- Added `RandomAccessReaderError` and `RandomAccessReaderBoundsError` enumerations to `RandomAccessReader.swift`, including `Sendable` and `Equatable` conformance so error diagnostics can travel safely across concurrency boundaries.
- Updated `MappedReader` and `ChunkedFileReader` to emit the shared error cases (invalid offset/count, bounds, IO, overflow) while performing overflow-safe range calculations.
- Refreshed the in-memory test reader and unit suites to cover the new error behaviours, including negative offsets, invalid counts, IO failure propagation, and arithmetic overflow detection.

## ðŸ”¬ Verification

- `swift test`

## ðŸ”­ Follow-Up

- Task A5: add benchmarking harnesses comparing mapped and chunked reader performance using the unified error taxonomy.
