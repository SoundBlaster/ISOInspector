# Next Tasks

- ✅ **E1 — Enforce Parent Containment and Non-Overlap** _(Completed — see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/159_E1_Enforce_Parent_Containment_and_Non_Overlap/Summary_of_Work.md` for implementation recap.)_: Extended structural validation so child boxes cannot exceed parent ranges, flagging overlapping payloads for CLI/UI surfaces. Planning notes remain in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/141_Summary_of_Work_2025-10-21_Sample_Encryption/E1_Enforce_Parent_Containment_and_Non_Overlap.md`.
- ✅ **Export Schema Verification Harness** _(Completed)_ — JSON exporter aliases and format summary coverage now ship across kit snapshots and CLI regression tests. See `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/152_F6_Export_Schema_Verification_Harness/Summary_of_Work.md` for implementation details.
- ⏳ **Real-World Assets** _(Blocked — awaiting external licensing approvals)_: Secure licensing for Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H fixtures so synthetic payloads can be replaced and regression baselines refreshed once approvals land.
