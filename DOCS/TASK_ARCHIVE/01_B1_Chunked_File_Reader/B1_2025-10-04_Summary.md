# B1 Chunked File Reader â€” Progress Summary (2025-10-04)

## Overview
- Delivered the `RandomAccessReader` protocol and `ChunkedFileReader` implementation, fulfilling Execution Workplan task B1.
- Reader supports configurable chunk sizes (default 1 MiB), chunk-aligned caching, and propagates underlying IO errors with context.
- Added comprehensive XCTest coverage covering sequential reads, cross-chunk spans, arbitrary offset seeks, EOF partial reads, out-of-bounds validation, and injected IO failure scenarios.

## Impact
- Provides the buffered IO foundation required by subsequent parser tasks (B2+), ensuring large files can be processed without full-memory loads.
- Establishes error taxonomy (`ChunkedFileReader.Error`) to guide upstream pipeline handling of IO edge cases.

## Next Considerations
- Extend endian helper utilities on top of `RandomAccessReader` for box header parsing (B2).
- Explore AsyncSequence exposure for streaming scenarios once parser layers demand it.
