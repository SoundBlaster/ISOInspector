# Summary of Work — 2025-10-26

## Completed Tasks
- **T1.7 — Finalize Traversal Guard Requirements**: Authored the
  `Traversal_Guard_Requirements.md` spec capturing forward-progress budgets,
  zero-length retry limits, recursion depth caps, and issue burst ceilings for
  tolerant parsing. Documented the associated `ParseIssue` codes,
  `ParsePipeline.Options` surface area, acceptance fixtures, and follow-up tasks
  required to implement and verify the guards.【F:DOCS/AI/Tolerance_Parsing/Traversal_Guard_Requirements.md†L9-L122】

## Verification
- Documentation review only (no automated tests run).

## Follow-Up Notes
- Implement traversal guard logic and fixtures per the new specification before
  enabling tolerant parsing in downstream aggregators.
