# Summary of Work — 2025-10-08

## Completed

- ✅ **C2 — Tree View Virtualization & Search** (archived in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/19_C2_Tree_View_Virtualization/`)
  - Added Combine-driven outline view model with search and severity filtering.
  - Introduced SwiftUI explorer surfaces with virtualization via `LazyVStack` plus severity toggles and parse state badges.
  - Seeded preview hierarchy data so the explorer renders without a live parse pipeline yet.

## Validation

- `swift test`

## Follow-ups

- Hook the outline explorer to actual file import and streaming parse sessions so snapshots arrive from user-selected
  MP4 files.
- Extend outline filters to cover box categories and streaming metadata (tracked via `@todo #6`).
