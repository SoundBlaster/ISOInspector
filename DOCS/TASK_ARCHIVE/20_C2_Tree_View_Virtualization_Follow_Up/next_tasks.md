# Next Tasks

- [x] Kick off **C2** â€” Tree view rendering using the new `ParseTreeStore` snapshots (outline UI, search, filters).
- [ ] Draft **C3** detail/hex stores that subscribe to the Combine bridge for payload slices and metadata panels.
- [x] Integrate the outline explorer with real file ingestion so parsing drives live snapshot updates.
