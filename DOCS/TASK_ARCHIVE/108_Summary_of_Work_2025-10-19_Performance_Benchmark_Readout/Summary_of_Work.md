# Summary of Work — 2025-10-19

## Completed Tasks

- **H4 — Performance Benchmark Validation**
  - Ran `LargeFileBenchmarkTests` under CI defaults and with `ISOINSPECTOR_BENCHMARK_INTENSITY=local`, confirming CLI throughput and random slice readers stay within budget.
  - Archived raw XCTest outputs and a human-readable summary under `Documentation/Performance/` for release-readiness reviews.
  - Updated PRD and execution guide trackers to mark H4 complete and direct future contributors to the archived summary.

## Documentation Updates

- Added `Documentation/Performance/2025-10-19-benchmark-summary.md` plus associated log files for the CI and local benchmark runs.
- Linked the new benchmark archive from `Documentation/ISOInspector.docc/Guides/ReleaseReadinessRunbook.md` so release managers use it as the baseline evidence packet.
- Moved `H4_Performance_Tests.md` to `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/107_H4_Performance_Benchmark_Validation/` and captured the outcome in a task-specific `Summary_of_Work.md`.

## Verification Commands

- `swift test --filter LargeFileBenchmarkTests`
- `ISOINSPECTOR_BENCHMARK_INTENSITY=local swift test --filter LargeFileBenchmarkTests`

## Follow-Ups

- Await macOS hardware for the Combine UI latency benchmark and fold the results into the shared baseline.
