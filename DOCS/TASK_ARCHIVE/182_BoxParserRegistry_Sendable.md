# Summary of Work — 2025-10-25

## Completed Tasks
- Annotated every parser registered via `BoxParserRegistry` as `@Sendable`, including helper utilities, to remove the implicit conversion warnings emitted at each `register(parser:for:)` call site.
- Updated the `BoxParserRegistryTests.testRegistryAllowsOverrides` fixture to store its custom closure in a `BoxParserRegistry.Parser`, guaranteeing the override closure itself is `@Sendable`.

## Implementation Notes
- Applied the annotation sweep across all `BoxParserRegistry+*.swift` extensions so default parsers now satisfy the registry’s `@Sendable` function signature without requiring compiler conversions.
- Adjusted the shared `parseChunkOffsets` helper to be `@Sendable` as well, keeping the chunk-offset parsers compliant.
- Converted the test override closure to the `Parser` alias before registration; this mirrors real usage and prevents the same warning from surfacing in unit tests.

## Tests
- `swift test --filter BoxParserRegistryTests` *(fails earlier with a `fatalError` while building ISOInspectorApp targets; additional investigation required — see build log in CLI output).*

## Follow-ups
- Track down the `fatalError` encountered during the app target build when running the focused test suite; the failure occurs after concurrency warnings in `DocumentSessionController` and `CoreDataAnnotationBookmarkStore`.
