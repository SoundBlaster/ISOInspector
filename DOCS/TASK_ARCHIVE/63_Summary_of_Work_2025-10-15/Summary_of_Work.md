# Summary of Work â€” 2025-10-15

## âœ… Completed Tasks

- A4 â€” RandomAccessReader Error Types (archived in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/62_A4_RandomAccessReader_Error_Types/`).

## ðŸ›  Implementation Notes

- Introduced the shared `RandomAccessReaderError` taxonomy and updated `MappedReader`, `ChunkedFileReader`, and `InMemoryRandomAccessReader` to emit consistent bounds, overflow, and IO errors.
- Extended unit coverage for negative offsets, invalid counts, overflow detection, and IO propagation in the chunked and
  mapped reader suites.

## ðŸ”¬ Verification

- `swift test`

## ðŸ”­ Pending Follow-Ups

- A5 â€” Build benchmarking harnesses comparing mapped and chunked readers with the unified error reporting.
