# Next Tasks

- [x] Implement automation for refreshing `MP4RABoxes.json` from the upstream registry and document the maintenance workflow (`@todo #2`).
- [ ] Extend downstream validation and reporting to consume the enriched MP4RA metadata emitted by `ParsePipeline.live()`.
- [ ] Outline the additional downstream parser follow-ups now unlocked by real-time streaming events (e.g., catalog

  integration test coverage and fallback handling).
