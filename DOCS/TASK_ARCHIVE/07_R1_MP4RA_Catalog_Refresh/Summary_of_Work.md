# Summary of Work — 2025-10-06

## Completed Tasks

- R1 — MP4RA Catalog Refresh Automation (`DOCS/INPROGRESS/07_R1_MP4RA_Catalog_Refresh.md`).

## Implementation Highlights

- Added `MP4RACatalogRefresher` and supporting HTTP data provider to `ISOInspectorKit`, including metadata-aware JSON generation and FourCC normalization.
- Extended the `isoinspect` CLI with a new `mp4ra refresh` command backed by dependency-injectable environment hooks for testing.
- Regenerated `MP4RABoxes.json` (1,167 entries) with embedded provenance metadata and updated `BoxCatalog` to remove the fulfilled puzzle reference.

## Documentation & Tracking

- Authored `Docs/Guides/MP4RARefreshGuide.md` describing the maintenance workflow.
- Updated `todo.md`, `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md`, research gap logs, and task archive summaries to reflect completion of Puzzle `@todo #2` (Research Task R1).

## Validation

- `swift test`
- `swift run isoinspect mp4ra refresh`

## Pending Follow-Ups

- Extend downstream validation/reporting to consume the enriched MP4RA metadata.
- Outline additional parser follow-ups enabled by real-time streaming events (see `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md`).
