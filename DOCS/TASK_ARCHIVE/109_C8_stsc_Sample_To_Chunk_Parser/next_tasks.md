# Next Tasks

## ðŸ”„ Sample Table Follow-Ups

- [ ] Implement `stsz/stz2` sample size parsing so validation can compare declared samples-per-chunk counts against concrete sample sizes. *(Track alongside C9 in `DOCS/AI/ISOViewer/ISOInspector_PRD_TODO.md`.)*
- [ ] Wire `stco/co64` chunk offset parsing and validation to correlate `stsc` ranges with physical media offsets. *(Coordinate with C10 backlog items in the same PRD tracker.)*
- [ ] Extend CLI and UI presentations to surface per-entry `stsc` details once the sample table view is designed. *(Capture UX requirements in the execution workplan before implementation.)*
