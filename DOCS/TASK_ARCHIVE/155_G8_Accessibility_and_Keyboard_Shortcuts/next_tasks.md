# Next Tasks

- ‚úÖ **E1 ‚Äî Enforce Parent Containment and Non-Overlap** _(Completed ‚Äî see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/159_E1_Enforce_Parent_Containment_and_Non_Overlap/Summary_of_Work.md` for implementation recap.)_: Extended structural validation so child boxes cannot exceed parent ranges, flagging overlapping payloads for CLI/UI surfaces. Planning notes remain in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/141_Summary_of_Work_2025-10-21_Sample_Encryption/E1_Enforce_Parent_Containment_and_Non_Overlap.md`.
- ‚úÖ **G8 ‚Äî Accessibility & Keyboard Shortcuts** _(Completed)_: Hardware focus shortcuts now flow through a shared catalog and Focus command menu so macOS and iPadOS expose the same key bindings and restore focus targets without pointer input. Summary recorded in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/155_G8_Accessibility_and_Keyboard_Shortcuts/Summary_of_Work.md`.
- ‚è≥ **Real-World Assets** _(Blocked ‚Äî awaiting external licensing approvals)_: Secure licensing for Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H fixtures so synthetic payloads can be replaced and regression baselines refreshed once approvals land.
- üîÑ **Snapshot & CLI Fixture Maintenance** _(Ongoing)_: Refresh snapshots and CLI fixtures whenever schema updates are intentional via `ISOINSPECTOR_REGENERATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 swift test --filter JSONExportSnapshotTests`.
