# Summary of Work — 2025-10-23

## Completed Tasks
- **G8 — Accessibility & Keyboard Shortcuts**: Centralized focus shortcuts in `InspectorFocusShortcutCatalog`, exposed a Focus command menu for macOS and iPadOS, and wired `ParseTreeExplorerView` to share focus bindings so outline, detail, notes, and hex panes respond to the same hardware commands.

## Implementation Notes
- Added reusable descriptors for focus shortcuts and bound them to both hidden keyboard accelerators and the new Focus command menu so discoverability and behavior remain consistent across platforms.
- Registered the explorer view's focus binding with the SwiftUI scene to keep `.focused` scopes synchronized when commands fire.
- Updated accessibility documentation and task tracking to reflect the keyboard navigation improvements.

## Tests
- `swift test`
- `swift test --filter InspectorFocusShortcutCatalogTests`

## Follow-Ups
- Conduct a manual VoiceOver regression pass on macOS and iPadOS hardware to confirm discoverability strings and focus announcements align with the updated commands.
