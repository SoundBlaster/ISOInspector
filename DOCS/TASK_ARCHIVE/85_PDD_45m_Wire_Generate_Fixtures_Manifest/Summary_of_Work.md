# Summary of Work — Manifest-Driven Fixture Acquisition

## Completed Tasks

- **PDD:45m Manifest-Driven Fixture Acquisition** — `generate_fixtures.py` now loads fixture manifests, streams downloads with SHA-256 validation, mirrors license texts, and supports dry-run verification. New unit tests cover successful downloads, checksum failures, and dry-run behavior.

## Implementation Notes

- Added `Documentation/FixtureCatalog/manifest.json` to track remote fixture metadata alongside mirrored license texts under `Documentation/FixtureCatalog/licenses/`.
- Updated fixture README with instructions for invoking the manifest workflow and clarified distribution/licensing
  paths.
- Introduced `Tests/test_generate_fixtures_manifest.py` to exercise the manifest pipeline via Python's unittest runner.

## Validation

- `python -m unittest Tests/test_generate_fixtures_manifest.py`
- `python Tests/ISOInspectorKitTests/Fixtures/generate_fixtures.py --skip-text-fixtures --manifest Documentation/FixtureCatalog/manifest.json --dry-run`

## Follow-Up

- Author the fixture storage README detailing mount paths for macOS runners and CI caches once infrastructure lands (tracked separately in `todo.md`).
