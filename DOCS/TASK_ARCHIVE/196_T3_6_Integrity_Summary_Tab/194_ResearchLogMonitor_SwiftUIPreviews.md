## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Ensure SwiftUI preview scenarios that render VR-006 research log data execute `ResearchLogMonitor.audit` so schema drift, missing fixtures, and empty payloads surface during design-time validation.

## ðŸ“Œ Immediate Focus
- Thread `ResearchLogPreviewProvider` snapshots through preview compositions so diagnostics appear alongside sample payloads.
- Back previews with canonical VR-006 fixtures plus mismatch/missing variants for regression visibility.
- Document the refresh process for preview fixtures when schema fields change to keep designers unblocked.
