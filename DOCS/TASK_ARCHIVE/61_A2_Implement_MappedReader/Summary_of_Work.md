# Summary of Work â€” 2025-10-15

## âœ… Completed Tasks

- **A2 â€” Implement `MappedReader`**: Added a memory-mapped `RandomAccessReader` implementation in `Sources/ISOInspectorKit/IO/MappedReader.swift` with bounds-checked slicing and graceful fallback when mapping is unavailable. Updated documentation trackers to mark the task complete and recorded verification notes in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/61_A2_Implement_MappedReader/A2_Implement_MappedReader.md`.

## ðŸ›  Implementation Highlights

- Introduced `MappedReader` that loads file contents via `Data(contentsOf:options:.mappedIfSafe)` and defends against invalid offsets, counts, and out-of-range requests.
- Added `MappedReaderTests` covering full and partial reads, zero-length slices, missing files, and boundary enforcement in `Tests/ISOInspectorKitTests/MappedReaderTests.swift`.
- Synchronized task tracking across `ISOInspector_PRD_TODO.md`, MVP checklists, and `next_tasks.md` to reflect the completed work.

## ðŸ”¬ Verification

- `swift test`

## ðŸ”­ Follow-Up

- Select the next priority from the remaining open TODO entries (for example, tasks A4 and A5 in the IO roadmap).
