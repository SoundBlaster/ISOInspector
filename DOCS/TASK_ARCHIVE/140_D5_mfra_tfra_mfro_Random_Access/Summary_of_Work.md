# Summary of Work — Task D5 (Random Access Tables)

## Completed
- Implemented parsed payload models for `mfra`, `tfra`, and `mfro` boxes, including typed track summaries and offset metadata exposed through `ParsedBoxPayload` accessors.
- Added dedicated random access parsers to `BoxParserRegistry`, wiring TaskLocal environment plumbing so `tfra` entries correlate with previously parsed `traf/trun` fragments.
- Extended `ParsePipeline` with a `RandomAccessIndexCoordinator` that tracks fragment order, provides lookup context to parsers, and emits aggregated `mfra` summaries alongside existing fragment payloads.
- Updated `EventConsoleFormatter` and `JSONParseTreeExporter` to surface random access metadata in CLI output and exported parse trees.
- Authored high-level and unit tests covering random access parsing, CLI formatting, and JSON export behaviors, including a new `TfraTrackFragmentRandomAccessParserTests` suite.

## Tests
- `swift test` — validates the full package build, including new random access tests.

## Documentation & Tracking
- Marked Task D5 complete across `todo.md`, `DOCS/AI/ISOViewer/ISOInspector_PRD_TODO.md`, and related MVP checklists.
- Recorded completion status in `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md` and captured implementation notes here for future reference.

## Follow-Up Ideas
- Add fragmented MP4 fixtures with `mfra` tables to regression snapshots once licensing clears the blocked real-world assets task.
- Expand coverage for edge cases such as `tfra` entries referencing missing fragments, zero-length tables, or non-uniform length size flags.
- Audit SwiftUI and app flows to display the new random access summaries once downstream UI tasks resume.
