# Next Tasks

- ✅ **D5 — `mfra/tfra/mfro` Random Access Tables** _(Completed — implementation details summarized in [Summary_of_Work.md](./Summary_of_Work.md))_: Build random access table parsing so fragment indexing metadata is available across ISOInspectorKit, CLI, and UI flows.
- ⏳ **Real-World Assets** _(Blocked — awaiting external licensing approvals)_: Secure licensing for Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H fixtures so synthetic payloads can be replaced and regression baselines refreshed once approvals land.
