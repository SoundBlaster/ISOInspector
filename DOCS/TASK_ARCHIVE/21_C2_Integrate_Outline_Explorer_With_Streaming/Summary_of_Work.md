# Summary of Work

## Completed Tasks

- **C2 â€” Integrate Outline Explorer with Streaming Sessions**
  - Bound `ParseTreeOutlineViewModel` to the Combine-backed `ParseTreeStore` snapshots so streaming parse events materialize immediately in the outline explorer.
  - Added latency instrumentation using `Logger` signposts and timestamp propagation on `ParseTreeSnapshot` to observe event-to-UI timing.
  - Updated SwiftUI explorer wiring to rely on the new binding path and removed preview-only sample data injection.

## Verification

- `swift test`

## Follow-up Notes

- Additional outline filters for box categories and streaming metadata remain tracked under `@todo #6`.
- Detail and hex panes (task C3) should connect to the same snapshot timestamps to share latency diagnostics once
  implemented.
