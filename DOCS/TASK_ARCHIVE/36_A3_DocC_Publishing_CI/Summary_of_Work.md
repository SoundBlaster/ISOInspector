# Summary of Work â€” DocC Publishing CI Automation

## Completed Tasks

- Implemented a `docc-archives` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that generates DocC documentation using the existing script and uploads the bundles as GitHub Actions artifacts.
- Updated repository planning documents (`todo.md`, `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md`, and related archive follow-up lists) to reflect that DocC publishing in CI is now complete.

## Validation

- Ensured the DocC generation script is invoked within CI and configured the artifact upload to fail when documentation
  output is missing.
- Local verification: `swift test`.

## Follow-up Notes

- Future DocC catalog enhancements remain tracked in the archive follow-up files; no additional CI work is required
  after enabling the artifact publishing job.
