# Summary of Work â€” F1 Fixture Expansion

## Completed Tasks

- F1: Expanded fixture corpus with fragmented MP4, DASH segments, large `mdat`, and malformed samples.
- PRD Phase H1 checklist updated to reflect new coverage.
- Root backlog item `#8` closed after catalog growth and metadata alignment.

## Implementation Highlights

- Added deterministic generation script (`Tests/ISOInspectorKitTests/Fixtures/generate_fixtures.py`) to rebuild all

  binary assets.

- Extended fixture catalog metadata and documentation to describe new scenarios and expected validation outcomes.
- Authored regression tests (`FixtureCatalogExpandedCoverageTests`) ensuring catalog entries expose the right box

  layout, payload sizing, and documented warnings/errors.

## Verification

- `swift test`
- `python3 Tests/ISOInspectorKitTests/Fixtures/generate_fixtures.py`

## Follow-up Notes

- Monitor future validation rules to refine expectation text per fixture as diagnostics evolve.
- Consider extending corpus with MOV and encrypted samples once parsing support lands.
