# VoiceOver Regression Pass for Accessibility Shortcuts (Blocked)

- **Original context:** Previously tracked in `DOCS/INPROGRESS/blocked.md` after the October 27, 2025 status review.
- **Reason for permanent block:** Required macOS and iPadOS hardware is unavailable, preventing VoiceOver verification across focus command menus.
- **What would be needed to resume:** Provision the missing hardware platforms with VoiceOver support and schedule regression coverage for focus targets, control announcements, and menu navigation.
- **Related archive:** See `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/156_G8_VoiceOver_Regression_Pass_for_Accessibility_Shortcuts/` for implementation history and reference checklists.
- **Last reviewed:** October 27, 2025.
