# Permanently Blocked Tasks

Use this directory to store tasks that cannot proceed without capabilities that are currently unattainable (for example, missing hardware, platform restrictions, or licensing barriers that have no defined path to resolution). Each file should include:

1. A descriptive title and date indicating when the task was retired.
2. The reason it is permanently blocked.
3. The prerequisite conditions that would allow the work to resume.
4. Links to any historical context in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE` or related specs.

When archiving current work, move any such tasks out of [`DOCS/INPROGRESS/blocked.md`](../../INPROGRESS/blocked.md) and into this folder so the day-to-day blocked list remains focused on recoverable issues.
