# Summary of Work — 2025-10-19

## Completed Tasks

- **C4 — Parse `mdhd` (Media Header) boxes.** Parser implemented in `ISOInspectorKit` and registered with the default `BoxParserRegistry` so CLI exports, the streaming pipeline, and SwiftUI detail panes can surface media header metadata.

## Implementation Highlights

- Consumed `FullBoxReader` to read versioned timestamps, timescale, duration, language, and reserved fields, returning a structured `ParsedBoxPayload` for both 32-bit and 64-bit layouts.
- Added language code decoding helpers and ensured short payloads cause the parser to return `nil` instead of partial data.
- Expanded `BoxParserRegistryTests` with fixtures for version 0 and version 1 payloads plus a short-payload regression case.

## Documentation & Tracking

- Marked C4 as complete in `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md`, the main PRD TODO, and the SwiftPM starter TODO lists so backlog status reflects the new parser.
- Updated Phase C parser notes to indicate the `hdlr` parser remains outstanding while `mdhd` is complete.

## Verification

- `swift test` (Linux container) — full package test suite, 180 tests executed with 1 skipped benchmark. See chunk `98c56b` for details.

## Follow-Ups

- Implement the `hdlr` (handler) parser to finish the remaining Phase C backlog item referenced in the MVP checklists.
