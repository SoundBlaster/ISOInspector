# Summary of Work — 2025-10-19

## Completed Tasks

- **C1 — Implement `ftyp` box parser**
  - Extended `ParsedBoxPayload` with a structured `fileType` detail so streaming parse events now carry decoded `major_brand`, `minor_version`, and the ordered `compatible_brands` list in addition to field annotations.
  - Updated the default `BoxParserRegistry` implementation to populate the structured payload while maintaining byte-range aware field extraction for UI annotations and exports.
  - Augmented the JSON parse tree exporter to persist the new structured payload in snapshot outputs, ensuring CLI exports, fixtures, and downstream consumers can surface the parsed metadata.
  - Added unit and integration coverage verifying structured payload propagation through the registry, live pipeline, and deterministic JSON exporter.

## Documentation Updates

- Archived `DOCS/INPROGRESS/C1_ftyp_Box_Parser.md` into this directory with this summary.
- Marked the task as complete in backlog trackers (`DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md`, `DOCS/AI/ISOInspector_PRD_TODO.md`, and starter PRD TODO).

## Verification

- `swift test`

## Pending Follow-Ups

- [ ] Leverage `ftyp` brand metadata together with `stsd` codec entries to drive the codec inference hooks referenced in the execution guide once those integration tasks are scheduled.
