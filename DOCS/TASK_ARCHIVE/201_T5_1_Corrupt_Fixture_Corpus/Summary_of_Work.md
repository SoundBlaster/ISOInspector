# Summary of Work â€” T5.1 Corrupt Fixture Corpus

## Deliverables
- Added deterministic corrupt fixtures under `Fixtures/Corrupt/` covering header decoding failures, truncated payloads, and traversal guard triggers for tolerant parsing.
- Authored `Documentation/FixtureCatalog/corrupt-fixtures.json` to catalogue corruption patterns, affected boxes, and expected `ParseIssue` codes with smoke-test hints.
- Extended `generate_fixtures.py` to emit the corrupt corpus alongside existing synthetic text fixtures, enabling reproducible regeneration.
- Created `CorruptFixtureCorpusTests` to validate manifest structure and ensure tolerant parsing processes smoke fixtures while recording documented issues.
- Updated fixture catalog documentation to describe the corrupt corpus workflow and reference the new manifest and tests.

## Verification
- `swift test --filter CorruptFixtureCorpusTests`
