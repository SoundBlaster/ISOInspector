# Next Tasks

- Kick off **T5.2** to automate regression tests across all corrupt fixtures, ensuring tolerant parsing records documented issues and tree structures remain partial instead of aborting.
- Coordinate with **T5.3** to surface corrupt corpus fixtures in UI smoke tests once table rendering harness is available.
- Extend fixture metadata with size heuristics or playback notes if downstream benchmarking (T5.4/T5.5) requires prioritisation.
