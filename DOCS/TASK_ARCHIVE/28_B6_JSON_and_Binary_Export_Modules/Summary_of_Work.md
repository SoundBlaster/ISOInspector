# Summary of Work — 2025-10-10

## Completed Tasks

- **B6 — JSON and Binary Export Modules**: Introduced reusable parse tree structures and exporters in ISOInspectorKit,
  plus CLI smoke coverage for the new APIs.

## Implementation Highlights

- Added `ParseTreeBuilder`, `ParseTreeNode`, and `ParseTree` to accumulate streaming `ParseEvent` values into reusable trees for export.
- Implemented `JSONParseTreeExporter` and binary capture encoder/decoder pairs backed by `PropertyListEncoder/Decoder` for deterministic persistence and round-tripping.
- Extended CLI scaffold tests to exercise the new exporters end-to-end via `ParseTreeBuilder`, ensuring future export commands have coverage.
- Synchronized `todo.md` and `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md` with follow-up puzzle **#9** for wiring dedicated CLI export commands.

## Verification

- `swift test`

## Follow-Up

- [x] #9 Add CLI export commands for JSON and binary captures using the new ISOInspectorKit exporters. (Completed in
  `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/29_D3_CLI_Export_Commands/`.)
