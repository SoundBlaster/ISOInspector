# B2+ — AsyncSequence Event Stream Integration — Summary of Work

## Completed Work
- Replaced the SwiftUI bridge with direct AsyncSequence consumption so `ParseTreeStore` drives updates from `ParsePipeline.events(for:context:)` without Combine intermediaries.
- Removed the obsolete `ParsePipelineEventBridge` implementation and refreshed iOS, iPadOS, and macOS build targets to drop the source file.
- Extended app tests and performance benchmarks to exercise the new streaming path, and refactored CLI/app fixtures to rely on the unified stream.

## Verification
- `swift test`

## Notes
- Follow-up: Surface tolerant parsing metrics in SwiftUI once the ribbon spec is finalized (`@todo PDD:45m` in `ParseTreeStore`).
