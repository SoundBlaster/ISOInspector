# Next Tasks

- [x] B2 — Header decoder implemented per `B2_Box_Header_Decoder.md` scope.
- [ ] B2+: Explore AsyncSequence exposure for streaming scenarios once parser layers demand it. _(In Progress — see `DOCS/INPROGRESS/B2_Plus_AsyncSequence_Event_Stream.md`.)_

Extracted from the archived B1 progress summary.
