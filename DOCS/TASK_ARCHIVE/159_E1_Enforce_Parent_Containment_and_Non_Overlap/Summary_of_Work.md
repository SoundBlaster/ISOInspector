# 159 â€” E1 Enforce Parent Containment and Non-Overlap

## Scope
Ensure VR-002 surfaces deterministic errors whenever a child box extends past its parent's payload range or overlaps previously parsed siblings so downstream CLI/UI surfaces remain trustworthy.

## Implementation
- Augmented `ContainerBoundaryRule` with explicit start/end comparisons, producing dedicated overlap and parent-range overflow diagnostics while keeping container stack recovery logic intact.
- Hardened stack accounting to preserve the furthest consumed offset, preventing later children from resetting parent boundaries after overlap detection.
- Added negative regression tests in `BoxValidatorTests` covering oversized children and overlapping siblings; verified the broader suite to guard against regressions in existing structural checks.

## Verification
- `swift test --filter BoxValidatorTests`

## Documentation Updates
- Archived the lightweight PRD under this directory and refreshed workplan/backlog trackers plus historical `next_tasks.md` rollups to mark E1 as completed.

## Follow-Ups
- Continue collecting malformed media samples to expand real-world containment/overlap fixtures (tracked under the Real-World Assets backlog item).
