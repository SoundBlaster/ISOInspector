# Summary of Work â€” 2025-10-23

## Completed Tasks

- None. VoiceOver regression remains pending until physical device verification is possible.

## Notes

- Documented the hardware limitation blocking the VoiceOver regression pass in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/156_G8_VoiceOver_Regression_Pass_for_Accessibility_Shortcuts/G8_VoiceOver_Regression_Pass_for_Accessibility_Shortcuts.md` so the next assignee knows why manual QA has not been executed.
- Confirmed automated regression coverage stays green by running `swift test` in the container environment to protect shortcut strings relied upon by VoiceOver announcements.

## Next Steps

- Run the VoiceOver regression pass on macOS 14+ and iPadOS 17+ hardware, capture announcements for each Focus shortcut, and archive the findings under Task G8.
- Attach any VoiceOver QA notes or screenshots to `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/155_G8_Accessibility_and_Keyboard_Shortcuts/` once physical testing is complete.
