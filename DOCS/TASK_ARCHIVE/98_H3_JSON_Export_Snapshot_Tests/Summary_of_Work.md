# Summary of Work

## Completed Tasks

- **Task H3 â€” JSON Export Snapshot Tests**
  - Added `JSONExportSnapshotTests` covering baseline, fragmented init, and DASH fixtures to guard JSON tree regressions.
  - Stored canonical baselines in `Tests/ISOInspectorKitTests/Fixtures/Snapshots/` with pretty-printed, sorted JSON for easy diffs.
  - Snapshot update workflow: run `ISOINSPECTOR_REGENERATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 swift test --filter JSONExportSnapshotTests` and review regenerated files before re-running the suite.
  - Verification: `swift test` (Linux container; Combine-dependent benchmarks remain skipped as expected).

## Follow-Ups

- None. Future schema or payload additions should refresh snapshots via the documented workflow.
