# Next Tasks

- **In Progress:** D3 â€” `traf/tfhd/tfdt/trun` parsing and validation to establish sample table scaffolding for fragment runs. See `./D3_traf_tfhd_tfdt_trun_Parsing.md` for the archived PRD.
- **Follow-Up:** Add integration coverage for multi-fragment assets once suitable fixtures are available to exercise the D2 monotonic validation paths end-to-end.
- Pending licensing: Acquire real-world fixtures for Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H codecs so synthetic payloads can be replaced and snapshot baselines refreshed once licensing clears.
