# Summary of Work â€” Fragment Fixture Coverage

## Completed Tasks
- **Fragment Fixture Coverage**: Added synthetic fragment fixtures covering multi-`trun` aggregation, negative `data_offset` handling, and fragments without `tfdt` while exercising version 0 composition offsets. Updated catalog metadata, fixture documentation, and JSON snapshot baselines so validator, CLI, and export flows incorporate the new assets.

## Implementation Notes
- Generated new base64 fixtures (`fragmented_multi_trun`, `fragmented_negative_offset`, `fragmented_no_tfdt`) via `generate_fixtures.py` and registered them in `Tests/ISOInspectorKitTests/Fixtures/catalog.json` with descriptive tags and expectations.
- Extended `FixtureCatalogExpandedCoverageTests`, `JSONExportSnapshotTests`, and the new `FragmentFixtureCoverageTests` to assert run aggregation, decode-time defaults, and CLI/export snapshots for the additional fixtures.
- Documented regeneration steps in `Documentation/FixtureCatalog/README.md` and `Tests/ISOInspectorKitTests/Fixtures/README.md`; marked the puzzle as complete in `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md`.

## Verification
- `swift test --filter FragmentFixtureCoverageTests`
- `swift test --filter JSONExportSnapshotTests`
