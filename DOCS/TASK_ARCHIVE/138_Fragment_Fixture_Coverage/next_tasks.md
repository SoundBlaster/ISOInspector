# Next Tasks

- ✅ **Fragment Fixture Coverage** _(Completed — see Summary_of_Work.md and [Fragment_Fixture_Coverage.md](Fragment_Fixture_Coverage.md))_: Multi-`trun`, negative `data_offset`, missing `tfdt`, and composition offset fixtures now cover the fragment parser edge cases.
- **Validator & CLI Polish:** Audit downstream consumers of the fragment summaries (validators, CLI formatting) and queue any readability or diagnostics adjustments enabled by the new data.
- **Real-World Assets:** Secure licensing for Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H fixtures so synthetic payloads can be replaced and regression baselines refreshed once approvals land.
