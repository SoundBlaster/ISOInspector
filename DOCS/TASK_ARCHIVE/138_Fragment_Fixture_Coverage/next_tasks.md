# Next Tasks

- ✅ **Fragment Fixture Coverage** _(Completed — see Summary_of_Work.md and [Fragment_Fixture_Coverage.md](Fragment_Fixture_Coverage.md))_: Multi-`trun`, negative `data_offset`, missing `tfdt`, and composition offset fixtures now cover the fragment parser edge cases.
- 🚧 **Validator & CLI Polish** _(In Progress — see [`DOCS/INPROGRESS/Validator_and_CLI_Polish.md`](../../INPROGRESS/Validator_and_CLI_Polish.md))_: Audit downstream consumers of the fragment summaries (validators, CLI formatting) and queue any readability or diagnostics adjustments enabled by the new data.
- ⏳ **Real-World Assets** _(Blocked — awaiting external licensing approvals)_: Secure licensing for Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H fixtures so synthetic payloads can be replaced and regression baselines refreshed once approvals land.
