# Integrate ResearchLogMonitor Audit with SwiftUI Previews ‚Äî Next Iteration

## üéØ Objective

Ensure SwiftUI preview scenarios that render VR-006 research log data execute `ResearchLogMonitor.audit` so schema drift, missing fixtures, and empty payloads surface during design-time validation.

## üìå Immediate Focus

- Thread `ResearchLogPreviewProvider` snapshots through preview compositions so diagnostics appear alongside sample payloads.
- Back previews with canonical VR-006 fixtures plus mismatch/missing variants for regression visibility.
- Document the refresh process for preview fixtures when schema fields change to keep designers unblocked.

## üîç Open Questions

- What lightweight dependency injection point lets previews call `ResearchLogMonitor.audit` without leaking app-only singletons?
- Can previews surface audit failures using the existing `FoundationUI` banner styles, or is a dedicated preview overlay required?

## ‚úÖ Implementation Summary ‚Äî 2025-10-29

- Removed the lingering PDD puzzle from `ResearchLogMonitor.audit` now that SwiftUI preview flows execute the audit through `ResearchLogPreviewProvider` snapshots.
- Confirmed preview fixtures (`VR006PreviewLog*.json`) remain bundled and continue to surface ready, missing, and schema mismatch diagnostics via `ResearchLogAuditPreview`.
- Updated active task trackers (`todo.md`, `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md`, and archive next-task lists) so #4 reflects its completed state.

## üìà Verification Notes

- Existing unit coverage in `ResearchLogPreviewProviderTests` exercises ready/missing/schema mismatch scenarios to ensure previews keep invoking the audit helper.
- `ResearchLogAccessibilityIdentifierTests` continues to host preview snapshots, guaranteeing diagnostics render with stable accessibility identifiers for automation.
