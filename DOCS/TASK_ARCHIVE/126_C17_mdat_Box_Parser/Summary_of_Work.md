# Summary of Work — 2025-10-20

## Completed Tasks

- C17 — Implemented the `mdat` parser so the streaming pipeline records byte ranges without loading payload data.

## Implementation Highlights

- Registered a dedicated `mdat` parser in `BoxParserRegistry` that emits a `MediaDataBox` detail with header offsets and payload range metadata.
- Extended `ParsedBoxPayload` and the JSON exporter to surface the structured `media_data` detail, refreshing CLI snapshot baselines for fixtures that include `mdat` boxes.
- Added regression coverage verifying the registry and live pipeline report the captured offsets while avoiding payload
  reads.

## Verification

- `swift test`

## Follow-Ups

- Track codec payload extensions (Task C16.4) and validation rule #15 as documented in the execution guide.
