# Next Tasks

- ✅ **E1 — Enforce Parent Containment and Non-Overlap** _(Completed — see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/159_E1_Enforce_Parent_Containment_and_Non_Overlap/Summary_of_Work.md` for implementation recap.)_: Extended structural validation so child boxes cannot exceed parent ranges, flagging overlapping payloads for CLI/UI surfaces. Planning notes remain in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/141_Summary_of_Work_2025-10-21_Sample_Encryption/E1_Enforce_Parent_Containment_and_Non_Overlap.md`.
- ✅ **R5 — Export Schema Standardization** _(Completed)_: Comparative schema analysis, canonical export recommendations, and verification plan documented in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/151_R5_Export_Schema_Standardization/R5_Export_Schema_Standardization.md` and summarized in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/151_R5_Export_Schema_Standardization/Summary_of_Work.md`.
- ⏳ **Real-World Assets** _(Blocked — awaiting external licensing approvals)_: Secure licensing for Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H fixtures so synthetic payloads can be replaced and regression baselines refreshed once approvals land.
