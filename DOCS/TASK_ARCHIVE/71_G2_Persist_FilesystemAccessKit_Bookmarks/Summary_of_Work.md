# Summary of Work â€” 2025-10-16

## Completed Tasks

- **G2 Persist FilesystemAccessKit Bookmarks** (`DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/71_G2_Persist_FilesystemAccessKit_Bookmarks/G2_Persist_FilesystemAccessKit_Bookmarks.md`)
  - Unified bookmark identifier persistence across the recents JSON store and workspace session snapshots by wiring `BookmarkPersistenceStore` into `DocumentSessionController`.
    - Normalized persisted payloads to strip raw bookmark blobs once identifiers are established. Ensured existing
      bookmark data migrates through the shared store on load.

## Implementation Notes

- Added a `BookmarkPersistenceManaging` abstraction so UI controllers and tests share a consistent bookmark store contract and enabled dependency injection for deterministic TDD scenarios.
- Updated `ISOInspectorApp` composition to provision a shared `BookmarkPersistenceStore` alongside the recents directory.
- Refreshed progress trackers (`todo.md`, `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md`) to reflect completion of the PDD milestone.

## Verification

- `swift test --disable-sandbox`

## Follow-Up

- None.
