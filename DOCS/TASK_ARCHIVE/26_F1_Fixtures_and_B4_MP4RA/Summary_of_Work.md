# Summary of Work

## Completed Tasks

- Bootstrapped an automated fixture catalog for task F1, including bundled metadata and the baseline QuickTime sample
  for ISOInspectorKit tests.
- Added FixtureCatalog unit tests to ensure fixture metadata is decoded and resources are accessible for regression
  coverage.

## Verification

- `swift test`

## Pending Follow-Ups

- Expand the fixture catalog with fragmented, DASH, and malformed assets plus validation expectations (`@todo #8`).
