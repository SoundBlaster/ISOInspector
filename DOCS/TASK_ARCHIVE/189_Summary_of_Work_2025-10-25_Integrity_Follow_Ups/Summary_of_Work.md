# Summary of Work — 2025-10-25

## Completed Tasks
- **T3.3 Integrity Detail Pane** — Added a corruption diagnostics section to the detail inspector, adaptive hex navigation for issue ranges, and accessibility updates. See `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/188_T3_3_Integrity_Detail_Pane/Summary_of_Work.md` for implementation notes.

## Tests
- `swift test`

## Follow-Ups
- Track T3.4 placeholder node integration so corruption diagnostics can link into placeholder affordances.
- Expand tolerant parsing fixtures with deeper corruption offsets to stress the new hex window logic.
