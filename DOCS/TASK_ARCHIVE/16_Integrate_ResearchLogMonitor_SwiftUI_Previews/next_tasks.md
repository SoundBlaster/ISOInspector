# Next Tasks

- [x] Integrate `ResearchLogMonitor.audit(logURL:)` with forthcoming SwiftUI previews so UI bindings stay aligned with the VR-006 research log schema.
- [x] Extend telemetry once UI smoke tests exist to monitor for missing VR-006 research log entries across CLI and UI

  consumers (handled by `ResearchLogTelemetryProbe` and UI smoke tests).
