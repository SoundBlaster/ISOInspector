# Summary of Work — October 8, 2025

## Completed Tasks

- Integrated `ResearchLogMonitor.audit(logURL:)` into SwiftUI previews through the new preview provider and diagnostics view scaffolding.

## Implementation Highlights

- Added `ResearchLogPreviewProvider` and deterministic VR-006 fixtures so previews reuse the same schema metadata that powers the CLI audit helper.
- Created `ResearchLogPreviewProviderTests` to guard success, missing fixture, and schema mismatch scenarios and keep the preview pipeline wired into `ResearchLogMonitor`.
- Introduced `ResearchLogAuditPreview` SwiftUI view plus preview scenarios that visualize schema alignment, drift, and missing fixture diagnostics for VR-006.

## Documentation & Tracking Updates

- Marked todo item `#4` and the matching next-task checklist entry as complete.

## Follow-up Actions

- ✅ `todo.md #5` completed by UI smoke telemetry coverage in `ResearchLogTelemetrySmokeTests`.
