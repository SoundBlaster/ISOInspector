# Summary of Work â€” Task B5 (VR-003 Metadata Comparison Rule)

## Completed Tasks

- Exercised the VR-003 validation path with focused unit coverage that checks matching, mismatching, truncated, and undersized payload scenarios using `BoxValidator` directly.
- Extended live parse integration tests to confirm catalog-aligned version/flag pairs remain warning-free while mismatches continue to emit VR-003 warnings that surface through the pipeline.
- Preserved CLI formatting expectations for VR-003 issues via the existing console formatter coverage.

## Tests & Verification

- `swift test`

## Documentation & Tracking Updates

- Archived the in-progress brief to `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/10_B5_VR003_Metadata_Comparison_Rule/` and produced this summary.
- Checked off the VR-003 action item in `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md` and in the B4 follow-up plan tracker.
- Updated the archive summary to reflect VR-003 completion and left VR-006 research logging as the remaining follow-up.

## Follow-Ups

- Advance VR-006 research logging so unknown catalog entries produce actionable info-level issues across CLI and UI pipelines.
- Broaden validation coverage for additional rules (VR-001, VR-002, VR-004, VR-005) as tracked by `@todo #3`.
