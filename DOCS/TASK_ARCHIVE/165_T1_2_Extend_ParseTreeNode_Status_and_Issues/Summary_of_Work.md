# Summary of Work — 2025-10-24

## Completed Tasks
- **T1.2 — Extend ParseTreeNode with Issues and Status Fields**

## Implementation Highlights
- Added tolerant parsing metadata to `ParseTreeNode` / `BoxNode`, including a `Status` enum and `issues: [ParseIssue]` storage with defaults that maintain source compatibility.
- Threaded the new properties through parse tree builders, stores, and detail view models so UI consumers can surface node status alongside validation issues.
- Updated JSON export payloads and regenerated snapshot fixtures to persist the new `status` and `issues` fields for downstream tooling.

## Verification
- `swift test`

## Follow-Up Notes
- Future tolerant parsing work (T1.3+) can now populate `ParseTreeNode.issues` and adjust statuses as the parser records recoverable faults.
