# Next Tasks

- ‚úÖ **E1 ‚Äî Enforce Parent Containment and Non-Overlap** _(Completed ‚Äî see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/159_E1_Enforce_Parent_Containment_and_Non_Overlap/Summary_of_Work.md` for implementation recap.)_: Extended structural validation so child boxes cannot exceed parent ranges, flagging overlapping payloads for CLI/UI surfaces. Planning notes remain in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/141_Summary_of_Work_2025-10-21_Sample_Encryption/E1_Enforce_Parent_Containment_and_Non_Overlap.md`.
- ‚úÖ **J2 ‚Äî Persist Security-Scoped Bookmarks** _(Completed)_: FilesystemAccessKit now logs bookmark identifiers, refreshes stale ledger entries, and removes invalid recents. See `DOCS/INPROGRESS/Summary_of_Work.md` for coverage details.
- üöß **VoiceOver Regression Pass for Accessibility Shortcuts** _(In Progress ‚Äî blocked without hardware)_: Run manual VoiceOver verification on macOS and iPadOS hardware to confirm the new focus command menu announces controls and restores focus targets as expected. Tracking details now live in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/156_G8_VoiceOver_Regression_Pass_for_Accessibility_Shortcuts/G8_VoiceOver_Regression_Pass_for_Accessibility_Shortcuts.md`.
- ‚è≥ **Real-World Assets** _(Blocked ‚Äî awaiting external licensing approvals)_: Secure licensing for Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H fixtures so synthetic payloads can be replaced and regression baselines refreshed once approvals land.
- üîÑ **Snapshot & CLI Fixture Maintenance** _(Ongoing)_: Refresh snapshots and CLI fixtures whenever schema updates are intentional via `ISOINSPECTOR_REGENERATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 swift test --filter JSONExportSnapshotTests`.
