# Summary of Work — 2025-10-12

## Completed / Attempted Tasks

- **Task:** Execute the Combine-backed UI benchmark on macOS (`DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/47_Combine_UI_Benchmark_macOS/47_Combine_UI_Benchmark_macOS.md`).
- **Status:** Blocked in the Linux CI container — XCTest skips the scenario because `Combine` is unavailable on this platform.

## Evidence

- Command: `swift test --filter LargeFileBenchmarkTests/testAppEventBridgeDeliversUpdatesWithinLatencyBudget`
- Outcome: `LargeFileBenchmarkTests.testAppEventBridgeDeliversUpdatesWithinLatencyBudget` reported `XCTSkip("Combine unavailable on this platform")`, so no latency metrics were generated.

## Next Actions

1. Re-run the benchmark on macOS hardware (Xcode 14 or newer) to collect latency, CPU, and memory metrics for the
   SwiftUI event bridge.
1. Archive the resulting measurements alongside the CLI throughput baselines so they can be compared against `PerformanceBenchmarkConfiguration` budgets.
1. Investigate surfacing the Linux skip status in CI dashboards or alerts to highlight that macOS coverage is
   outstanding until a native runner is wired up.
