# Summary of Work — 2025-10-12

## Completed Tasks

- **D1 — Scaffold CLI Base Command:** Introduced an `isoinspector` root command powered by `swift-argument-parser` with placeholder `inspect`, `validate`, and `export` subcommands plus shared context bootstrap for future streaming operations.

## Implementation Notes

- Added the Swift ArgumentParser dependency to `Package.swift` and updated the CLI target along with its tests to link the new product.
- Created `ISOInspectorCommand`, `ISOInspectorCommandContext`, and `ISOInspectorCommandContextStore` to wire shared `ISOInspectorCLIEnvironment` state and expose global options for upcoming telemetry toggles.
- Updated the CLI entry point to execute the new command, leaving legacy runner logic in place for existing tests, and captured new coverage in `ISOInspectorCommandTests`.

## Tests

- `swift test`

## Follow-ups

- [ ] PDD:45m Surface global logging and telemetry toggles once streaming metrics are exposed to the CLI.
- [ ] PDD:1h Execute streaming inspection by consuming ParsePipeline events when Task D2 builds the streaming command.
- [ ] PDD:1h Produce validation reports with streaming pipeline once Task D2 defines the CLI output contract.
- [ ] PDD:45m Route export operations to streaming capture utilities as they migrate from ISOInspectorCLIRunner.
