# Summary of Work — 2025-10-19

## ✅ Completed Tasks

- **C10 — `stco/co64` Chunk Offset Parser**: Added dedicated registry entries and parsing logic for both 32-bit (`stco`) and 64-bit (`co64`) chunk offset boxes. The shared `ParsedBoxPayload` model now carries normalized offset arrays, and JSON export snapshots capture the new structured payload.

## 🧪 Verification

- `swift test --filter StcoChunkOffsetParserTests`
- `swift test --filter JSONExportSnapshotTests`
- `swift test`

## 🔁 Follow-Up Actions

- Implement validation rule #15 to correlate `stsc` chunk runs, `stsz/stz2` sample sizes, and the newly parsed chunk offsets.
