# Next Tasks

- ðŸš§ **T3.6 â€” Integrity Summary Tab** _(In Progress â€” see `DOCS/INPROGRESS/T3_6_Integrity_Summary_Tab.md`)_:
  - Wire the Integrity tab layout so aggregated `ParseIssue` rows support severity sorting, filtering, and node focus.
  - Connect Share menu actions to the refreshed plaintext and JSON exporters without diverging from ribbon and detail pane counts.
- âœ… **#4 Integrate ResearchLogMonitor Audit Into SwiftUI Previews** _(Completed â€” see `DOCS/INPROGRESS/194_ResearchLogMonitor_SwiftUIPreviews.md` for closure notes)_:
  - Preview compositions consume `ResearchLogPreviewProvider` snapshots, surfacing audit diagnostics for ready, missing, and schema mismatch fixtures.
