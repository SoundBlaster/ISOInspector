# Integrate ResearchLogMonitor Audit with SwiftUI Previews (2025-10-27 Refresh)

> Earlier investigation notes are archived in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/194_T4_2_Plaintext_Issue_Export_Closeout/194_ResearchLogMonitor_SwiftUIPreviews.md`.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Ensure SwiftUI preview scenarios that render VR-006 research log data execute `ResearchLogMonitor.audit` so schema drift, missing fixtures, and empty payloads are surfaced during design-time validation.

## ðŸ“Œ Immediate Focus
- Thread `ResearchLogPreviewProvider` snapshots through preview compositions so diagnostics appear alongside sample payloads.
- Back previews with canonical VR-006 fixtures plus mismatch/missing variants for regression visibility.
- Document the refresh process for preview fixtures when schema fields change to keep designers unblocked.

## âœ… Completion Notes â€” 2025-10-29

- VR-006 preview bundles continue to supply ready, missing, and schema mismatch fixtures that exercise `ResearchLogMonitor.audit` during SwiftUI preview rendering.
- Diagnostics emitted by `ResearchLogPreviewProvider` surface in `ResearchLogAuditPreview`, with accessibility identifiers verified by UI hosting tests.
- Refer to the refreshed status in `DOCS/INPROGRESS/194_ResearchLogMonitor_SwiftUIPreviews.md` and `todo.md` for the closed #4 tracker entry.
