## 2025-10-27 â€” T4.4 Sanitize Tolerant Exports

- Updated `JSONParseTreeExporter` to replace base64 payload fields with byte-length metadata for metadata item list values and data reference entries, preventing binary leakage in tolerant reports. The corresponding unit coverage lives in `Tests/ISOInspectorKitTests/ParseExportTests.swift`.
- Refreshed the tolerance workplan, integration summary, and in-progress tracker to mark T4.4 complete and document the privacy audit outcome.
- Captured the implementation details and verification notes in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/195_T4_4_Sanitize_Issue_Exports/195_T4_4_Sanitize_Issue_Exports.md`.
- Tests: `swift test`
