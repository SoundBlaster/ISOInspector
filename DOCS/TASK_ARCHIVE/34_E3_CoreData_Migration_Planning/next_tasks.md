# Next Tasks â€” Post-CoreData Annotation Persistence

- [ ] Expand CLI and app DocC catalogs with tutorials and screenshots as the new annotation and bookmark workflows

  mature.

- [x] Add DocC publishing to CI (e.g., GitHub Actions artifact uploads) after storage and hosting requirements are

  validated. (Handled by the GitHub Actions `docc-archives` job that ships DocC bundles as downloadable artifacts.)
