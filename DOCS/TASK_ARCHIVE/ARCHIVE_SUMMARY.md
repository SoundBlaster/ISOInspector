# Task Archive Summary

## 01_A2_Configure_CI_Pipeline
- **Original file:** `DOCS/INPROGRESS/A2_Configure_CI_Pipeline.md`
- **Archived location:** `DOCS/ARCHIVE/01_A2_Configure_CI_Pipeline/A2_Configure_CI_Pipeline.md`
- **Purpose:** Establish an automated GitHub Actions workflow that builds and tests the ISOInspector Swift package on every pull request, preventing regressions before merge.
- **Scope highlights:** Create the CI workflow, configure status checks, and prepare for future linting or static analysis enhancements while leaving release automation and DocC publishing out of scope.
- **Key next steps:** Scaffold `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, set up Swift tooling on CI runners, cache builds, and ensure `swift build` plus `swift test` run automatically with clear failure logs.

## 03_B2_Plus_Streaming_Interface_Evaluation
- **Archived files:** `B2_Plus_Streaming_Interface_Evaluation.md`, `B3_Streaming_Parse_Pipeline.md`, `F1_Test_Fixtures.md`, `Summary_of_Work.md`, and the prior `next_tasks.md`.
- **Archived location:** `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/03_B2_Plus_Streaming_Interface_Evaluation/`
- **Purpose:** Capture the investigation and documentation around introducing an asynchronous `ParsePipeline`, follow-on parser implementation notes, and fixture planning to support streaming validation.
- **Key outcomes:** Established the `ParsePipeline` event model, recorded parser integration guidance, and documented fixture needs while rolling follow-up implementation into Puzzle #1.
