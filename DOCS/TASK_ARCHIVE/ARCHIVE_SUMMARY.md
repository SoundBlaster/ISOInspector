# Task Archive Summary

## 01_A2_Configure_CI_Pipeline
- **Original file:** `DOCS/INPROGRESS/A2_Configure_CI_Pipeline.md`
- **Archived location:** `DOCS/ARCHIVE/01_A2_Configure_CI_Pipeline/A2_Configure_CI_Pipeline.md`
- **Purpose:** Establish an automated GitHub Actions workflow that builds and tests the ISOInspector Swift package on every pull request, preventing regressions before merge.
- **Scope highlights:** Create the CI workflow, configure status checks, and prepare for future linting or static analysis enhancements while leaving release automation and DocC publishing out of scope.
- **Key next steps:** Scaffold `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, set up Swift tooling on CI runners, cache builds, and ensure `swift build` plus `swift test` run automatically with clear failure logs.

## 03_B2_Plus_Streaming_Interface_Evaluation
- **Archived files:** `B2_Plus_Streaming_Interface_Evaluation.md`, `B3_Streaming_Parse_Pipeline.md`, `F1_Test_Fixtures.md`, `Summary_of_Work.md`, and the prior `next_tasks.md`.
- **Archived location:** `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/03_B2_Plus_Streaming_Interface_Evaluation/`
- **Purpose:** Capture the investigation and documentation around introducing an asynchronous `ParsePipeline`, follow-on parser implementation notes, and fixture planning to support streaming validation.
- **Key outcomes:** Established the `ParsePipeline` event model, recorded parser integration guidance, and documented fixture needs while rolling follow-up implementation into Puzzle #1.

## 04_B3_ParsePipeline_Live_Streaming
- **Archived files:** `B3_ParsePipeline_Live_Streaming.md`, `Summary_of_Work.md`, and the in-progress `next_tasks.md` checklist.
- **Archived location:** `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/04_B3_ParsePipeline_Live_Streaming/`
- **Highlights:** Documents completion of the streaming `ParsePipeline.live()` implementation, including validation of nested box traversal, offset accounting, and regression coverage through targeted unit tests.
- **Next steps carried forward:** Continue Puzzle #1 by connecting the live pipeline to the production streaming walker so concrete parsing logic runs end-to-end.

## 05_B3_Puzzle1_ParsePipeline_Live_Integration
- **Archived files:** `05_B3_Puzzle1_ParsePipeline_Live_Integration.md`, `Summary_of_Work.md`, and the completed `next_tasks.md` checklist.
- **Archived location:** `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/05_B3_Puzzle1_ParsePipeline_Live_Integration/`
- **Highlights:** Captures the implementation details for wiring `ParsePipeline.live()` to the production `StreamingBoxWalker`, including validation of nested traversal, cancellation propagation, and concrete streaming integration tests.
- **Next steps carried forward:** Follow Puzzle #1 with Task B4 by integrating the MP4RA metadata catalog and related downstream parser work; these items now live in `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md`.

## 06_B4_MP4RA_Metadata_Integration
- **Archived files:** `B4_MP4RA_Metadata_Integration.md`, `Summary_of_Work.md`, and the prior `next_tasks.md` checklist captured during Task B4.
- **Archived location:** `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/06_B4_MP4RA_Metadata_Integration/`
- **Highlights:** Records integration of the MP4RA-backed `BoxCatalog` into the streaming pipeline, inclusion of the bundled metadata fixture, and expanded diagnostics plus coverage for standard and UUID-based boxes.
- **Next steps carried forward:** âœ… Automation for refreshing `MP4RABoxes.json` now ships via R1 (`DOCS/INPROGRESS/07_R1_MP4RA_Catalog_Refresh.md`). Continue extending downstream validation/reporting that consumes enriched metadata and outline the parser follow-ups enabled by real-time streaming events.
