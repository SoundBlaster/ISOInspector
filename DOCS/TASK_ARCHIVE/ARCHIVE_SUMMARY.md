# Task Archive Summary

## 01_A2_Configure_CI_Pipeline
- **Original file:** `DOCS/INPROGRESS/A2_Configure_CI_Pipeline.md`
- **Archived location:** `DOCS/ARCHIVE/01_A2_Configure_CI_Pipeline/A2_Configure_CI_Pipeline.md`
- **Purpose:** Establish an automated GitHub Actions workflow that builds and tests the ISOInspector Swift package on every pull request, preventing regressions before merge.
- **Scope highlights:** Create the CI workflow, configure status checks, and prepare for future linting or static analysis enhancements while leaving release automation and DocC publishing out of scope.
- **Key next steps:** Scaffold `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, set up Swift tooling on CI runners, cache builds, and ensure `swift build` plus `swift test` run automatically with clear failure logs.
