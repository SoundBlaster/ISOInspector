## Documentation Updates

- Added `Documentation/ISOInspector.docc/Guides/ReleaseReadinessRunbook.md` as the canonical release playbook for QA, distribution, and communications.
- Archived micro PRD under `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/59_F5_Finalize_Release_Checklist_and_Go_Live_Runbook/` and noted outstanding hardware-dependent QA runs.

## Tests & Automation

- Documentation-only iteration; validated Markdown formatting with `scripts/fix_markdown.py` and Markdownlint prior to commit.

## Outstanding Puzzles

- [ ] Schedule macOS UI automation and Combine benchmarks when hardware is available; attach evidence to the release QA log.
- [ ] Evaluate hosted DocC publishing so release artifacts stay discoverable beyond GitHub Releases.
