# Summary of Work — 2025-10-20

## Completed Tasks

- **C14c — Edit List Duration Reconciliation**
  - Introduced validation rule **VR-014** to reconcile edit list presentation spans with `mvhd`, `tkhd`, and `mdhd` durations and to surface unsupported playback rates.
  - Added streaming coverage ensuring media duration diagnostics defer until the owning `mdhd` payload is parsed, preserving order-agnostic validation.

## Implementation Highlights

- Extended `BoxValidator` with a stateful edit list rule that tracks movie- and track-level context, computes tolerance-aware tick differences, and emits targeted messages for gaps, overruns, and rate anomalies.
- Expanded `ParsePipelineLiveTests` with regression cases exercising mismatched durations, deferred media reconciliation, and unsupported rate combinations.

## Verification

- `swift test` (all packages)

## Follow-Ups

- C14d: refresh fixtures, exports, and snapshots to incorporate the new VR-014 diagnostics across empty, offset, and
  rate-adjusted edit list scenarios.
- Validation Rule #15: maintain compatibility between the new edit list checks and upcoming chunk/sample correlation
  diagnostics.
