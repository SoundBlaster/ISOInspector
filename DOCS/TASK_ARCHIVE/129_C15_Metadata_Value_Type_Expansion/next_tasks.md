# Next Tasks

## Metadata Follow-Up

- [x] Surface additional MP4RA metadata data types (e.g., GIF, TIFF, signed fixed-point) once fixtures land so CLI/app exports stay human-readable. Track progress alongside the archived implementation details in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/128_C15_Metadata_Value_Decoding_Expansion/` and the backlog entries in `todo.md`. _(Completed — see `DOCS/INPROGRESS/C15_Metadata_Value_Type_Expansion.md`.)_

## Validation Follow-Up

- [x] Validation Rule #15. Correlate `stsc` chunk runs, `stsz/stz2` sample sizes, and `stco/co64` offsets to flag mismatches alongside the edit list duration diagnostics archived in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/122_C14c_Edit_List_Duration_Validation/`. *(Completed — captured in `DOCS/INPROGRESS/Summary_of_Work.md`.)*
