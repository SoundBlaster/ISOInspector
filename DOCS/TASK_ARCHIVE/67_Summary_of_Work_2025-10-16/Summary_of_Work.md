# Summary of Work — 2025-10-16

## Completed Tasks

- **E5 Surface Document Load Failures** — Added controller-published load failure state, surfaced the SwiftUI banner with retry/dismiss controls, and extended unit/UI coverage. See `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/66_E5_Surface_Document_Load_Failures/Summary_of_Work.md` for full details.

## Validation

- `swift test`

## Follow-Ups

- Continue logging-focused PDD tasks: surface recents/session persistence diagnostics once the telemetry pipeline is

  ready.

- Mac-specific automation and benchmark runs remain blocked per `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md`.
