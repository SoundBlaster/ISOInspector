# Summary of Work — Task B4 (MP4RA Metadata Integration)

## Completed Tasks

- Integrated the MP4RA-backed `BoxCatalog` and wired it into `ParsePipeline.live()` so streaming events include metadata for known boxes and log unknown identifiers once per run.
- Added bundled MP4RA JSON fixture and decoding infrastructure with cross-platform diagnostics support.
- Expanded ParsePipeline live tests and introduced dedicated catalog tests covering standard and UUID-based lookups.

## Tests & Verification

- `swift test`

## Documentation & Tracking Updates

- Checked off the MP4RA catalog integration item in `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md`.
- Added `@todo #2` to track automation of MP4RA catalog refreshes and mirrored it in `todo.md`.

## Follow-Ups

- ✅ Implement automation for refreshing `MP4RABoxes.json` from the upstream registry and document the maintenance workflow (`@todo #2`) via R1 (`DOCS/INPROGRESS/07_R1_MP4RA_Catalog_Refresh.md`).
- Extend downstream validation and reporting to consume the enriched metadata (future task planning).
