# Summary of Work — C14a Finalize `edts/elst` Parser Scope

## Completed Tasks

- Authored the definitive `elst` parser scope describing box placement, version-specific field widths, field semantics, and
  normalization rules for segment duration, media time, and fixed-point rate conversion.【F:DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/120_C14a_Finalize_Edit_List_Scope/C14a_Finalize_Edit_List_Scope.md†L1-L60】
- Catalogued validation checkpoints that reconcile edit list durations with `mvhd`/`tkhd` metadata and highlight unsupported
  rate or duplicate edit list scenarios.【F:DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/120_C14a_Finalize_Edit_List_Scope/C14a_Finalize_Edit_List_Scope.md†L62-L88】
- Documented streaming considerations and downstream task dependencies to guide implementation, validation, and fixture refresh
  follow-ups across tasks C14b–C14d.【F:DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/120_C14a_Finalize_Edit_List_Scope/C14a_Finalize_Edit_List_Scope.md†L90-L117】

## Documentation Updates

- Archived the scope document at `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/120_C14a_Finalize_Edit_List_Scope/C14a_Finalize_Edit_List_Scope.md` for use by
  parser, validation, and fixture owners.

## Tests & Automation

- Documentation-only iteration; no automated tests were run. Markdown formatting validated via `scripts/fix_markdown.py` prior
  to commit.

## Outstanding Puzzles

- [ ] Execute C14b–C14d implementation, validation, and fixture updates using the documented scope as input.
