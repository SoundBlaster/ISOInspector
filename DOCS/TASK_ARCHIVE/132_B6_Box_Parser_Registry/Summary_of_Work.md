# Summary of Work — 2025-10-20

## Completed Tasks
- **B6 — Box Parser Registry:** Added a shared fallback that returns placeholder payload metadata for unknown boxes and refreshed JSON export baselines to reflect the richer structure.

## Implementation Notes
- Introduced a default placeholder parser in `BoxParserRegistry` so unregistered boxes surface byte-range context instead of producing `nil` payloads.
- Added unit coverage (`testDefaultFallbackProvidesPlaceholderPayloadForUnknownBox`) to guarantee the placeholder payload shape.
- Regenerated JSON export snapshots to capture the new placeholder fields in baseline, streaming, and edit-list fixtures.

## Tests
- `swift test`

## Follow-ups
- Continue sourcing real-world codec fixtures (Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, MPEG-H) to replace synthetic payloads once licensing clears.
