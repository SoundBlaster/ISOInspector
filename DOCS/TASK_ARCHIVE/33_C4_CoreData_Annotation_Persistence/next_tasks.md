# Next Tasks â€” C4 Annotation/Bookmark Follow-ups

- [x] Implement CoreData-backed annotation and bookmark storage following the R6 decision record.
- [x] Wire the CoreData store into SwiftUI editing surfaces so annotations and bookmarks update live in the UI.
- [ ] Expand CLI and App DocC catalogs with tutorials and screenshots as new UI and command features land.
- [ ] Add DocC publishing to CI (e.g., GitHub Actions artifact uploads) after storage and hosting requirements are

  validated.
