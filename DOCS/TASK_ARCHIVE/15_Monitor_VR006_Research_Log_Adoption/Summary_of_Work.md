# Summary of Work — Monitor VR-006 Research Log Adoption

## Completed Tasks

- Implemented a CLI schema banner sourced from the shared `ResearchLogSchema` so

  both CLI and UI consumers observe the same VR-006 research log fields during
  inspection sessions.

- Added `ResearchLogMonitor.audit(logURL:)` to deliver a programmatic checkpoint

  that verifies stored research log files conform to the supported schema.

- Documented the integration checkpoints in

  [`VR006_Monitoring_Checklist.md`](./VR006_Monitoring_Checklist.md) and updated
  the task brief with the current status.

## Tests & Validation

- `swift test` — Validates new CLI output expectations and the schema audit

  helper.

## Follow-Ups

- ✅ SwiftUI previews now integrate the audit helper via `ResearchLogPreviewProvider`.

- ✅ UI smoke telemetry (`ResearchLogTelemetrySmokeTests`) watches for missing VR-006 entries.
