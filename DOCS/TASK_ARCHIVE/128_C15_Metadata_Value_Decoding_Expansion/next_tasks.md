# Next Tasks

## Metadata Follow-Up

- [x] Expand metadata value decoding for additional data types surfaced by future fixtures so CLI exports stay aligned with MP4RA guidance. Track coverage opportunities against `DOCS/AI/ISOViewer/ISOInspector_PRD_TODO.md`. **(Completed — see `DOCS/INPROGRESS/C15_Metadata_Value_Decoding_Expansion.md` and `DOCS/INPROGRESS/Summary_of_Work.md`.)**
- [ ] Surface additional MP4RA metadata data types (e.g., GIF, TIFF, signed fixed-point) once fixtures land so CLI/app exports stay human-readable. Mirror progress with `@todo` in `BoxParserRegistry+Metadata.swift` and entry in `todo.md`.

## Validation Follow-Up

- [x] Validation Rule #15. Correlate `stsc` chunk runs, `stsz/stz2` sample sizes, and `stco/co64` offsets to flag mismatches alongside the edit list duration diagnostics archived in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/122_C14c_Edit_List_Duration_Validation/`. *(Completed — summarized in `DOCS/INPROGRESS/Summary_of_Work.md`.)*
