# Next Tasks

- üöß **D6 ‚Äî Sample Encryption Placeholder Parsing** _(In Progress)_: Recognize `senc`, `saio`, and `saiz` boxes during fragment parsing so the pipeline records their offsets/sizes and surfaces presence to CLI/UI consumers without attempting decryption. Context lives in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/141_Summary_of_Work_2025-10-21_Sample_Encryption/D6_Recognize_senc_saio_saiz_Placeholders.md`.
- ‚úÖ **E1 ‚Äî Enforce Parent Containment and Non-Overlap** _(Completed ‚Äî see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/159_E1_Enforce_Parent_Containment_and_Non_Overlap/Summary_of_Work.md` for implementation recap.)_: Extended structural validation so child boxes cannot exceed parent ranges, flagging overlapping payloads for CLI/UI surfaces. Planning notes remain in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/141_Summary_of_Work_2025-10-21_Sample_Encryption/E1_Enforce_Parent_Containment_and_Non_Overlap.md`.
- ‚úÖ **D7 ‚Äî Validation Preset CLI Wiring** _(Completed)_: CLI preset selection, alias flags, metadata propagation, and coverage notes now live in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/148_D7_Validation_Preset_CLI_Wiring/Summary_of_Work.md`, with planning retained in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/148_D7_Validation_Preset_CLI_Wiring/D7_Validation_Preset_CLI_Wiring.md`.
- üîÅ **Validation Export Metadata Enhancements** _(Follow-up)_: Extend CLI, JSON, and session state exports to include the active preset identifier plus any disabled rule IDs now that `ValidationConfiguration` is archived in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/145_B7_Validation_Rule_Preset_Configuration/`.
- ‚è≥ **Real-World Assets** _(Blocked ‚Äî awaiting external licensing approvals)_: Secure licensing for Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H fixtures so synthetic payloads can be replaced and regression baselines refreshed once approvals land.
- ‚úÖ **Codec Validation Coverage Expansion** _(Completed ‚Äî see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/149_Codec_Validation_Coverage_Expansion/Summary_of_Work.md` for integration coverage.)_
