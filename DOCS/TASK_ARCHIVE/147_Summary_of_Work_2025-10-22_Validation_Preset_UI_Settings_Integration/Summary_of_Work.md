# Summary of Work — 2025-10-22

## Completed Tasks
- **C19 — Validation Preset UI Settings Integration**

## Implementation Highlights
- Added validation metadata plumbing so `ParseTree` and JSON exports now surface the active preset and disabled rule identifiers for downstream consumers.
- Introduced a file-backed validation configuration store, wired `DocumentSessionController` to load/save global defaults, manage workspace overrides, and propagate rule filters into `ParseTreeStore` snapshots.
- Created a macOS settings scene with `ValidationSettingsView` that exposes preset selection, per-rule toggles, scope switching, and reset-to-global behavior backed by the new controller APIs.
- Extended workspace session snapshots to persist per-file validation overrides alongside bookmark metadata so overrides restore with documents.
- Updated state stores and tests to exercise filtering, persistence, and export metadata flows across app and kit targets.

## Verification
- `swift test` (2025-10-22)

## Follow-ups
- Manual QA pass on the macOS Settings pane to confirm preset selection, custom override labeling, and reset behavior.
- Ensure CLI wiring (Task D7) surfaces the same configuration metadata for full E7 coverage.
