# ISOInspector Execution Guide

This directory consolidates implementation-ready documentation for the ISOInspector project. The files are structured to guide autonomous agents through project objectives, requirements, architecture, and execution plans without additional clarification.

## Contents
- `01_Project_Scope.md` — Objective definition, deliverables, constraints, and dependencies.
- `02_Product_Requirements.md` — Feature-level requirements, flows, and edge cases.
- `03_Technical_Spec.md` — Detailed architecture, data contracts, and component responsibilities.
- `04_TODO_Workplan.md` — Dependency-aware task breakdown with metadata for autonomous execution.
- `05_Research_Gaps.md` — Outstanding unknowns and targeted investigation tasks.
- `07_FourCharContainerEnum_PRD.md` — Plan for consolidating container-type checks into a shared enum.
- `08_MediaAndIndexBoxes_PRD.md` — Roadmap for migrating `mdat`, `sidx`, and `styp` handling into strongly typed enum cases.

Each file adheres to the structure and quality rules defined in `DOCS/RULES/01_PRD.md`, ensuring consistent terminology, explicit acceptance criteria, and actionable guidance for LLM-based implementation.
