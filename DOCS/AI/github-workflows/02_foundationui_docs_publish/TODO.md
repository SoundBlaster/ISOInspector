# TODO: FoundationUI DocC GitHub Pages Deployment

- [x] Capture requirements and scope in `prd.md`, referencing the ISOInspector documentation workflow precedent.
- [x] Add `.github/workflows/foundationui-documentation.yml` mirroring the ISOInspector publisher but targeting the `FoundationUI` Swift package.
- [x] Ensure the workflow bundles `.nojekyll` and an `index.html` redirect to `documentation/foundationui/` inside the `gh-pages` artifact.
- [ ] (Optional) Add README/Docs linkout to the FoundationUI Pages URL once the site is live.
- [ ] (Optional) Create a combined landing page that links both ISOInspector and FoundationUI docs for discoverability.
