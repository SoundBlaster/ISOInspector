# C7 â€” Connect Bookmark Diffs to Persisted Bookmarks

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Reconcile CoreData session bookmark diff entities with the persisted bookmark records so the session store,
recents list, and annotation features stay in sync after Task E3's persistence foundations.

## ðŸ§© Context

- Execution workplan Task C7 highlights the need to link bookmark diff entities with their persisted counterparts.
- Task E3 delivered the CoreData schema and live persistence flows; this follow-up closes the remaining reconciliation

  gap.

- The `todo.md` PDD:1h item mirrors this work so planning views stay consistent.

## âœ… Success Criteria

- Bookmark diff reconciliation updates or removes CoreData records without duplication or orphaned entries.
- Automated tests cover add, update, and delete flows across CoreData and JSON-backed stores.
- Session restoration continues to present the latest bookmark state in UI and CLI surfaces without regressions.

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Notes

- Review `CoreDataAnnotationBookmarkStore` and `AnnotationBookmarkSession` to confirm how diffs are generated and applied.
- Confirm FilesystemAccessKit bookmark identifiers remain valid after reconciliation merges.
- Extend `AnnotationBookmarkStoreTests`, `WorkspaceSessionStoreTests`, and `DocumentSessionControllerTests` to cover this path.
