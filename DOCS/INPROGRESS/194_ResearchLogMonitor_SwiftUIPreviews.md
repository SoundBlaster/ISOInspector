## üéØ Objective

Ensure SwiftUI preview scenarios that render VR-006 research log data execute `ResearchLogMonitor.audit` so schema drift, missing fixtures, and empty payloads surface during design-time validation.

## üìå Immediate Focus

- Thread `ResearchLogPreviewProvider` snapshots through preview compositions so diagnostics appear alongside sample payloads.
- Back previews with canonical VR-006 fixtures plus mismatch/missing variants for regression visibility.
- Document the refresh process for preview fixtures when schema fields change to keep designers unblocked.

## üîç Open Questions

- What lightweight dependency injection point lets previews call `ResearchLogMonitor.audit` without leaking app-only singletons?
- Can previews surface audit failures using the existing `FoundationUI` banner styles, or is a dedicated preview overlay required?
