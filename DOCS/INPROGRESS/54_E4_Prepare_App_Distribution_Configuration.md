# E4 ‚Äî Prepare App Distribution Configuration

## üéØ Objective

Establish the ISOInspector app's distribution scaffolding by defining bundle identifiers, configuring required
entitlements, and validating notarization tooling so macOS builds are ready for signing and release workflows.

## üß© Context

- Phase E of the execution workplan shifts from session persistence into packaging activities; Task E4 depends on the

  integrated app shell delivered by E2 so that distribution settings apply to the functioning UI
  target.„ÄêF:DOCS/AI/ISOInspector_Execution_Guide/04_TODO_Workplan.md‚Ä†L39-L45„Äë

- The technical spec requires release artifacts to include a notarized app bundle, meaning distribution configuration

  must cover signing identities and automation hooks for CI
  delivery.„ÄêF:DOCS/AI/ISOInspector_Execution_Guide/03_Technical_Spec.md‚Ä†L89-L104„Äë

- Packaging and sandboxing updates in Task E4 directly unblock downstream release documentation and entitlement

  hardening tracked in the packaging backlog.„ÄêF:DOCS/AI/ISOInspector_PRD_TODO.md‚Ä†L246-L251„Äë

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

- Bundle identifiers and versioning metadata recorded for macOS, iPadOS, and iOS targets and referenced by CI build

  scripts.

- App sandbox entitlements finalized for file access, bookmark persistence, and optional automation hooks, with

  validation via signing tools.

- Notarization pipeline exercised end-to-end (locally or via CI) to confirm the packaged app is accepted by Apple

  notarization services.

- Documentation updates summarizing distribution settings and prerequisites for future automation tasks.

## üöÄ Implementation Progress ‚Äî 2025-10-13

- Added a versioned `DistributionMetadata.json` resource that records bundle identifiers, marketing version `0.1.0`, build

  number `1`, and the active development team placeholder used by automation scripts. The metadata is exercised by
  `DistributionMetadataTests` to ensure SwiftPM targets can decode it during CI runs.„ÄêF:Sources/ISOInspectorKit/Resources/Distribution/DistributionMetadata.json‚Ä†L1-L21„Äë„ÄêF:Tests/ISOInspectorKitTests/DistributionMetadataTests.swift‚Ä†L1-L30„Äë

- Introduced `DistributionMetadataLoader` in ISOInspectorKit so Swift-based tooling can load the canonical metadata from

  `Bundle.module`, keeping distribution settings versioned alongside the package code.„ÄêF:Sources/ISOInspectorKit/Distribution/DistributionMetadata.swift‚Ä†L1-L44„Äë

- Created platform-specific entitlement plists for macOS, iOS, and iPadOS builds under `Distribution/Entitlements`. The

  macOS definition enables the App Sandbox plus security-scoped bookmarks for persisted file access and documents the
  outstanding Apple Events review as a tracked
puzzle.„ÄêF:Distribution/Entitlements/ISOInspectorApp.macOS.entitlements‚Ä†L1-L13„Äë„ÄêF:Distribution/Entitlements/ISOInspectorApp.iOS.entitlements‚Ä†L1-L7„Äë„ÄêF:Distribution/Entitlements/ISOInspectorApp.iPadOS.entitlements‚Ä†L1-L7„Äë

- Authored `scripts/notarize_app.sh` to standardize notarization submissions. The script reads the team identifier from

  the shared metadata resource, supports dry-run execution for Linux containers, and documents the `notarytool`
  credential workflow.„ÄêF:scripts/notarize_app.sh‚Ä†L1-L75„Äë

- Added a Tuist `Project.swift` that imports the shared distribution metadata, applies marketing/build versions, and

  sets platform-specific bundle identifiers plus entitlements for generated Xcode
projects.„ÄêF:Tuist/Project.swift‚Ä†L1-L111„Äë

## üîß Implementation Notes

- Inventory existing Xcode project settings (targets, provisioning profiles) and align them with SwiftPM package

  structure to avoid duplicated identifier definitions.

- Define entitlement files (.entitlements) per platform variant covering sandbox, security-scoped bookmarks, and

  automation/test allowances, and add regression checks in CI to flag unexpected diffs.

- Script notarization flows using `notarytool` with placeholder credentials, ensuring secrets are injected through CI secure storage and providing dry-run guidance for local validation.
- Coordinate with documentation tasks (F4, F5) so user manuals and release checklists inherit accurate bundle IDs,

  signing identities, and notarization verification steps once E4 stabilizes the configuration.

- Generate the release Xcode project with Tuist so distribution-critical build settings (bundle IDs, provisioning profile mapping, build configurations) are codified in versioned `Project.swift` definitions that align with the SwiftPM-first workspace mandated in the technical spec; this keeps CI/App Store builds reproducible while still emitting a canonical `.xcodeproj` for signing and upload tooling.„ÄêF:DOCS/AI/ISOInspector_Execution_Guide/03_Technical_Spec.md‚Ä†L92-L101„Äë
