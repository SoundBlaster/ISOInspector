# Execute the Combine-backed UI Benchmark on macOS

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Capture baseline latency and throughput metrics from the SwiftUI streaming bridge on a macOS system that ships Combine
so we can confirm the UI meets the PRD latency budget and matches the CLI benchmark results.

## ðŸ§© Context

- The master PRD requires streaming UI updates to land under 200â€¯ms while handling large MP4 inputs, so we need
  platform-accurate numbers rather than Linux skips.
- Task F2 introduced automated performance harnesses, leaving this macOS-only Combine benchmark as the outstanding
  follow-up to validate the UI event bridge end-to-end.

## âœ… Success Criteria

- Run `LargeFileBenchmarkTests.testAppEventBridgeDeliversUpdatesWithinLatencyBudget` on a macOS host with Combine available and record measured latency/CPU/memory samples.
- Document the captured measurements alongside the CLI benchmark results, highlighting whether they satisfy `PerformanceBenchmarkConfiguration` budgets.
- File issues or TODO updates if the benchmark exceeds limits; otherwise, publish the findings in the performance
  tracking log.

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Notes

- Use Xcode or `xcodebuild test` on macOS so the Combine-specific test is compiled and executed instead of skipped behind `#if canImport(Combine)` guards.
- Ensure large temporary fixtures generated by `LargeFileBenchmarkFixture` have sufficient disk space and are cleaned up after runs.
- Compare metrics against `PerformanceBenchmarkConfiguration.uiLatencyBudgetSeconds()` and document any needed adjustments to budgets or fixture sizes.
