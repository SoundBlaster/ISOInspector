# T3.6 — Integrity Summary Tab — Implementation Summary

## 📋 Overview

Successfully implemented a dedicated Integrity tab that consolidates all `ParseIssue` entries into a sortable, filterable table, enabling operators to triage corruption issues without manually scanning the outline.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. IntegritySummaryViewModel Implementation
**Location:** `Sources/ISOInspectorApp/Integrity/IntegritySummaryViewModel.swift`

- Created view model that observes `ParseIssueStore` for real-time issue updates
- Implemented sorting by severity (default), offset, and affected node
- Added severity-based filtering with toggle controls
- Integrated Combine publishers for reactive UI updates
- Follows MVVM pattern consistent with existing codebase architecture

**Key Features:**
- Default sort by severity (Error > Warning > Info)
- Severity filter allows users to show/hide specific issue levels
- Reactive updates when ParseIssueStore changes

### 2. IntegritySummaryView Implementation
**Location:** `Sources/ISOInspectorApp/Integrity/IntegritySummaryView.swift`

- Created SwiftUI view with sortable issue table
- Implemented filter bar with severity toggle buttons
- Added empty state view when no issues are present
- Integrated export buttons in toolbar (JSON and Issue Summary)
- Each issue row displays:
  - Severity icon with color coding
  - Issue code and message
  - Byte offset (when available)
  - Affected node ID
  - Navigation button to focus node in tree

**UI Components:**
- Header with dynamic title based on context
- Filter bar with severity toggles
- Sort controls (Severity, Offset, Node)
- Scrollable issue list with IssueRow components
- Empty state with checkmark icon

### 3. ParseTreeExplorerView Integration
**Location:** `Sources/ISOInspectorApp/Tree/ParseTreeOutlineView.swift`

- Extended ParseTreeExplorerView with TabView system
- Added two tabs:
  - **Explorer** tab: Existing tree + detail view layout
  - **Integrity** tab: New IntegritySummaryView
- Implemented dynamic header that changes based on selected tab
- Connected issue selection to node navigation
- When user clicks an issue, the app:
  1. Selects the affected node via `DocumentViewModel.nodeViewModel`
  2. Switches back to Explorer tab
  3. Focuses the node in the tree view

### 4. Export Integration
**Location:** `Sources/ISOInspectorApp/AppShellView.swift`

- Connected IntegritySummaryView to existing export infrastructure
- Added document-level export handlers:
  - `exportDocumentJSONHandler`
  - `exportDocumentIssueSummaryHandler`
- Export buttons appear in Integrity tab toolbar
- Reuses existing `DocumentSessionController` export methods
- Maintains consistency with Explorer tab export functionality

### 5. DocumentViewModel Enhancement
**Location:** `Sources/ISOInspectorApp/State/DocumentViewModel.swift`

- Made `store` property internal (was private) to enable access from ParseTreeExplorerView
- Allows IntegritySummaryView to access `ParseIssueStore` directly

### 6. Test Coverage
**Location:** `Tests/ISOInspectorAppTests/IntegritySummaryViewTests.swift`

- Created comprehensive unit tests following TDD methodology
- Tests cover:
  - Issue display in view
  - Sorting by severity
  - Empty state rendering
  - View model integration
- Uses `NSHostingView` for SwiftUI view testing
- Includes helper extensions for text content verification

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Separation of Concerns:**
   - `IntegritySummaryViewModel`: Business logic and data transformation
   - `IntegritySummaryView`: Presentation and user interaction
   - Follows existing MVVM pattern used in outline and detail views

2. **TabView Integration:**
   - Chose TabView approach to provide clear separation between Explorer and Integrity views
   - Maintains familiar tab-based navigation pattern for macOS users
   - Header dynamically updates to show contextual information

3. **Navigation Flow:**
   - Issue selection triggers node focus in tree view
   - Automatically switches to Explorer tab to show focused node
   - Preserves user context while enabling quick navigation

### Code Quality

- Adheres to "One File, One Entity" principle (Rule 1)
- Files kept under 400 lines (Rule 2)
- Used structs for domain data instead of tuples (Rule 3)
- Followed PDD methodology with @todo markers for future work

### PDD Puzzles Created

The implementation includes @todo markers for deferred work:

- `#T36-001`: Implement offset-based sorting refinement
- `#T36-002`: Implement affected node sorting refinement
- `#T36-003`: Navigate to affected node when issue is selected (already working, marker for documentation)

## 📊 Success Criteria Met

✅ **Integrity tab appears alongside tree/detail panes** — Implemented as TabView with Explorer and Integrity tabs

✅ **Lists aggregated ParseIssue rows** — IntegritySummaryView displays all issues from ParseIssueStore

✅ **Default severity sorting** — Issues sorted by Error > Warning > Info by default

✅ **Controls to sort by offset and affected node** — Sort picker allows switching between Severity, Offset, and Node sorting

✅ **Severity filters adjust table contents** — Toggle buttons filter issues by severity level

✅ **Ribbon counts and detail pane badges stay in sync** — Uses existing ParseIssueStore metrics, no duplicate state

✅ **Selecting table row focuses associated node** — handleIssueSelected() navigates to node and switches to Explorer tab

✅ **Share/Export actions reuse existing exporters** — Connected to DocumentSessionController export methods

✅ **Exported counts match tab and ribbon totals** — Uses same ParseIssueStore data source

## 🔄 Methodology Applied

### TDD (Test-Driven Development)
1. ✅ Wrote failing acceptance tests first
2. ✅ Implemented minimal code to make tests pass
3. ✅ Refactored while keeping tests green

### XP (Extreme Programming)
1. ✅ Small, incremental changes
2. ✅ Continuous refactoring
3. ✅ Test coverage maintained
4. ✅ Simple design that meets requirements

### PDD (Puzzle-Driven Development)
1. ✅ Minimal implementation with @todo markers
2. ✅ Code is source of truth for remaining work
3. ✅ Atomic commits with clear messages
4. ✅ Master branch stays deployable

## 🚀 Commit Reference

**Commit:** `37e1faa`
**Message:** "T3.6: Add Integrity Summary tab with issue filtering and navigation"

## 🎯 Next Steps (Future Work)

While the core functionality is complete, the following enhancements are deferred as PDD puzzles:

1. **Offset-based sorting refinement** (#T36-001)
   - Current implementation sorts by byte range lower bound
   - Consider multi-field sorting for ties

2. **Affected node sorting refinement** (#T36-002)
   - Current implementation sorts by first affected node ID
   - Consider sorting by node depth or hierarchy

3. **Additional filter options**
   - Filter by issue code pattern
   - Filter by affected node type
   - Filter by byte range

4. **UI Enhancements**
   - Keyboard shortcuts for tab switching
   - Context menu on issue rows for quick actions
   - Issue detail popover on hover

5. **Accessibility**
   - Add accessibility identifiers for UI automation
   - VoiceOver labels for all interactive elements
   - Keyboard navigation improvements

6. **Performance**
   - Virtualized list for large issue counts
   - Incremental loading for very large files

## 📖 Documentation References

- Implementation follows guidelines in `DOCS/RULES/02_TDD_XP_Workflow.md`
- Code structure adheres to `DOCS/RULES/07_AI_Code_Structure_Principles.md`
