# F4 â€” User Manual for CLI and App Workflows

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Explain ISOInspector use in SwiftUI and CLI so users review media and export reports without the source docs.

## ðŸ§© Context

- Execution workplan task **F4** assigns the user manual now that streaming UI and CLI features are complete.
- The master PRD lists documentation alongside the core library, app, and CLI deliverables.
- Backlog notes show the app shell, streaming integration, and CLI commands are stable and ready to document.

## âœ… Success Criteria

- Manual covers launching the app, opening files, using tree/detail/hex panes, search, filters, and persistence cues.
- Manual documents CLI `inspect`, `validate`, and export commands with arguments, usage samples, and output guidance.
- Troubleshooting highlights validation warnings, benchmark limits, and platform needs like macOS-only Combine metrics.

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Notes

- Review archived notes for D2, D3, E2, and E3 to extract confirmed workflows and capture updated screenshots.
- Cross-link DocC tutorials and the developer onboarding guide to avoid duplicating shared explanations.
- Flag blocked follow-ups (macOS UI automation and Combine benchmarks) so readers know when hardware is required.
