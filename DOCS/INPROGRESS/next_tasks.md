# Next Tasks

- ✅ **T3.4 Placeholder Nodes for Missing Children** _(Completed — synthetic nodes surface expected-but-absent structures; see `DOCS/INPROGRESS/Summary_of_Work.md`)_
- 🚀 **T3.5 Contextual Status Labels** _(In Progress — see `DOCS/INPROGRESS/T3_5_Contextual_Status_Labels.md`)_:
  - Thread tolerant parsing status metadata (Invalid, Empty, Corrupted, Partial, Trimmed) through the outline rows and detail inspector so operators can distinguish issue severity at a glance.
- 🚧 **VoiceOver Regression Pass for Accessibility Shortcuts** _(Blocked — pending hardware)_:
  - Schedule macOS and iPadOS hardware verification to confirm focus command menus announce controls and restore focus targets. Reference `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/156_G8_VoiceOver_Regression_Pass_for_Accessibility_Shortcuts/`.
- ⏳ **Real-World Assets** _(Blocked — awaiting licensing approvals)_:
  - Secure Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H fixtures so regression baselines can shift from synthetic payloads once approvals land.
