# Next Tasks

- 🚧 **E1 — Enforce Parent Containment and Non-Overlap** _(In Progress)_: Extend structural validation so child boxes cannot exceed parent ranges, flagging overlapping payloads for CLI/UI surfaces. Planning notes remain in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/141_Summary_of_Work_2025-10-21_Sample_Encryption/E1_Enforce_Parent_Containment_and_Non_Overlap.md`.
- 🚧 **J2 — Persist Security-Scoped Bookmarks** _(In Progress)_: Finalize FilesystemAccessKit bookmark storage so recents/session restoration relies on persisted security scopes, adds recovery for stale entries, and documents the workflow in `DOCS/INPROGRESS/J2_Persist_Security_Scoped_Bookmarks.md`.
- 🚧 **VoiceOver Regression Pass for Accessibility Shortcuts** _(In Progress — blocked without hardware)_: Run manual VoiceOver verification on macOS and iPadOS hardware to confirm the new focus command menu announces controls and restores focus targets as expected. Tracking details now live in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/156_G8_VoiceOver_Regression_Pass_for_Accessibility_Shortcuts/G8_VoiceOver_Regression_Pass_for_Accessibility_Shortcuts.md`.
- ⏳ **Real-World Assets** _(Blocked — awaiting external licensing approvals)_: Secure licensing for Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H fixtures so synthetic payloads can be replaced and regression baselines refreshed once approvals land.
- 🔄 **Snapshot & CLI Fixture Maintenance** _(Ongoing)_: Refresh snapshots and CLI fixtures whenever schema updates are intentional via `ISOINSPECTOR_REGENERATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 swift test --filter JSONExportSnapshotTests`.
