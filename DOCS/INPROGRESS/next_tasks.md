# Next Tasks

## Metadata Follow-Up

- [ ] Expand metadata value decoding for additional data types surfaced by future fixtures so CLI exports stay aligned with MP4RA guidance. Track coverage opportunities against `DOCS/AI/ISOViewer/ISOInspector_PRD_TODO.md`.

## Validation Follow-Up

- [ ] Validation Rule #15. Correlate `stsc` chunk runs, `stsz/stz2` sample sizes, and `stco/co64` offsets to flag mismatches alongside the edit list duration diagnostics archived in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/122_C14c_Edit_List_Duration_Validation/`.

## Parser Baseline

- [ ] In Progress — C17 `mdat` parser capturing offsets and payload size while skipping media data. See `DOCS/INPROGRESS/C17_mdat_Box_Parser.md` for scope.
