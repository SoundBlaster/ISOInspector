# Next Tasks

- **Validator & CLI Polish:** Audit downstream consumers of the new fragment fixture metadata (validators, CLI formatting, JSON export snapshots) and queue readability or diagnostics adjustments enabled by the expanded coverage.
- **Real-World Assets:** Secure licensing for Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H fixtures so synthetic payloads can be replaced and regression baselines refreshed once approvals land.
