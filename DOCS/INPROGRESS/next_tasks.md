# Next Tasks

## üî≠ IO Roadmap Priorities

- [ ] Evaluate Tasks A4 and A5 from the IO roadmap to extend the random-access reader surface with explicit error types and benchmarking. See backlog details in `DOCS/AI/ISOViewer/ISOInspector_PRD_TODO.md` (items A4‚ÄìA5) and `todo.md` for remaining platform diagnostics work.

## üß™ Streaming UI Coverage

- [ ] Run `ParseTreeStreamingSelectionAutomationTests` on macOS hardware with XCTest UI support to validate the end-to-end SwiftUI automation flow introduced in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/48_macOS_SwiftUI_Automation_Streaming_Default_Selection/48_macOS_SwiftUI_Automation_Streaming_Default_Selection.md`. **(Blocked ‚Äî macOS UI testing entitlements unavailable in container; see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/50_Summary_of_Work_2025-02-16/51_ParseTreeStreamingSelectionAutomation_macOS_Run.md`.)**

## üî¨ Benchmark Follow-Up

- [ ] Execute the Combine-backed UI benchmark on macOS to capture latency metrics on a platform that ships Combine, keeping throughput parity with the CLI harness. **(Blocked ‚Äî requires macOS runner with Xcode/Combine; see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/50_Summary_of_Work_2025-02-16/50_Combine_UI_Benchmark_macOS_Run.md`.)**
  - Latest container attempt (`2025-10-12`) confirmed XCTest skips the scenario on Linux because `Combine` is unavailable; macOS hardware run still required. See `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/47_Combine_UI_Benchmark_macOS/Summary_of_Work.md` for details.

## üõ†Ô∏è Session Persistence Follow-Ups

- [ ] Surface session persistence errors once diagnostics plumbing is available. See `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/52_E3_Session_Persistence/Summary_of_Work.md`.
- [ ] Reconcile CoreData session bookmark diffs with live bookmark entities when reconciliation rules are defined. See `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/52_E3_Session_Persistence/Summary_of_Work.md`.

## üì¶ Distribution Follow-Up

- [ ] Track outcome of the notarized build Apple Events automation assessment alongside `todo.md` entry ‚ÄúPDD:30m Evaluate whether automation via Apple Events is required for notarized builds and extend entitlements safely.‚Äù Reference archival notes in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/57_Distribution_Apple_Events_Notarization_Assessment/56_Distribution_Apple_Events_Notarization_Assessment.md`.
