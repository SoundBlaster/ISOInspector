# Next Tasks

- ‚úÖ **D6 ‚Äî Sample Encryption Placeholder Parsing** _(Completed ‚Äî see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/141_Summary_of_Work_2025-10-21_Sample_Encryption/Summary_of_Work.md`.)_: Regression fixtures (`sample-encryption-placeholder`), ParsePipeline/CLI/App coverage, and documentation updates now verify encryption metadata end to end.
- üöß **E1 ‚Äî Enforce Parent Containment and Non-Overlap** _(In Progress)_: Extend structural validation so child boxes cannot exceed parent ranges, flagging overlapping payloads for CLI/UI surfaces; planning notes remain in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/141_Summary_of_Work_2025-10-21_Sample_Encryption/E1_Enforce_Parent_Containment_and_Non_Overlap.md`.
- ‚è≥ **Real-World Assets** _(Blocked ‚Äî awaiting external licensing approvals)_: Secure licensing for Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H fixtures so synthetic payloads can be replaced and regression baselines refreshed once approvals land.
- ‚úÖ **Codec Validation Coverage Expansion** _(Completed ‚Äî see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/149_Codec_Validation_Coverage_Expansion/Summary_of_Work.md`.)_: Expanded ParsePipeline integration tests plus CLI/JSON coverage so VR-018 codec diagnostics surface end to end.
