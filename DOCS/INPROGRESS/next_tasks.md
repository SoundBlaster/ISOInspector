# Next Tasks

## ðŸš§ In Progress

- **D1 â€” Scaffold CLI base command**: Establish the `isoinspector` executable target and root command using `swift-argument-parser` so downstream streaming commands (Task D2) can share consistent infrastructure.

## ðŸ“‹ Ready Queue

- **D2 â€” Implement `inspect` and `validate` commands** *(blocked by completion of D1)*.
- **E1 â€” Build SwiftUI app shell with document browser and recents list** *(ready once CLI scaffolding stabilizes;
  depends on completed C1 foundation)*.
- **F2 â€” Configure performance benchmarks for large files** *(requires stabilized parsing pipeline from Phase B and
  streaming fixtures already delivered).*
