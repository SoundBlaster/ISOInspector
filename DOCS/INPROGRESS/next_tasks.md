# Next Tasks

- üõ†Ô∏è **T3.4 Placeholder Nodes for Missing Children** _(In Progress ‚Äî see `DOCS/AI/Tolerance_Parsing/TODO.md`)_:
  - Follow T3.3 with placeholder affordances so tolerant parsing issues can guide operators toward absent structures and hex jumps remain contextual.
- üöß **VoiceOver Regression Pass for Accessibility Shortcuts** _(Blocked ‚Äî pending hardware)_:
  - Schedule macOS and iPadOS hardware verification to confirm focus command menus announce controls and restore focus targets. Reference `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/156_G8_VoiceOver_Regression_Pass_for_Accessibility_Shortcuts/`.
- ‚è≥ **Real-World Assets** _(Blocked ‚Äî awaiting licensing approvals)_:
  - Secure Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H fixtures so regression baselines can shift from synthetic payloads once approvals land.
