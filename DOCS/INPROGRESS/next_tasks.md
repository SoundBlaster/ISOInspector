# Next Tasks

- üõ†Ô∏è **T4.1 ‚Äî Extend JSON Export Schema for Issues** _(In Progress)_:
  - Encode tolerant parsing diagnostics into JSON exports so CLI and automation workflows inherit corruption context from lenient runs. See `DOCS/INPROGRESS/T4_1_Extend_JSON_Export_Schema_for_Issues.md` for scope and success criteria.
- üöß **VoiceOver Regression Pass for Accessibility Shortcuts** _(Blocked ‚Äî pending hardware)_:
  - Schedule macOS and iPadOS hardware verification to confirm focus command menus announce controls and restore focus targets. Reference `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/156_G8_VoiceOver_Regression_Pass_for_Accessibility_Shortcuts/`.
- ‚è≥ **Real-World Assets** _(Blocked ‚Äî awaiting licensing approvals)_:
  - Secure Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H fixtures so regression baselines can shift from synthetic payloads once approvals land.
