- üöß **VoiceOver Regression Pass for Accessibility Shortcuts** _(In Progress ‚Äî blocked without hardware)_: Track manual VoiceOver verification on macOS and iPadOS hardware to confirm the focus command menu announces controls and restores focus targets as expected.

- ‚è≥ **Real-World Assets** _(Blocked ‚Äî awaiting external licensing approvals)_: Secure Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H fixtures so regression baselines can shift from synthetic payloads once approvals land.
- üîÑ **Snapshot & CLI Fixture Maintenance** _(Ongoing)_: Refresh snapshots and CLI fixtures whenever schema updates are intentional via `ISOINSPECTOR_REGENERATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 swift test --filter JSONExportSnapshotTests`.
