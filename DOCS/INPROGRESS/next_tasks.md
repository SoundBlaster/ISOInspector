# Next Tasks

- üöß **D6 ‚Äî Sample Encryption Placeholder Parsing** _(In Progress)_: Recognize `senc`, `saio`, and `saiz` boxes during fragment parsing so the pipeline records their offsets/sizes and surfaces presence to CLI/UI consumers without attempting decryption.
- üöß **E1 ‚Äî Enforce Parent Containment and Non-Overlap** _(In Progress)_: Extend structural validation so child boxes cannot exceed parent ranges, flagging overlapping payloads for CLI/UI surfaces; context captured in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/141_Summary_of_Work_2025-10-21_Sample_Encryption/E1_Enforce_Parent_Containment_and_Non_Overlap.md`.
- üöß **E3 ‚Äî Warn on Unusual Top-Level Ordering** _(In Progress)_: Add an advisory validator that highlights unexpected `ftyp`/`moov` ordering patterns, coordinating messaging with VR-004/VR-005 work; execution tracked in `DOCS/INPROGRESS/E3_Warn_on_Unusual_Top_Level_Ordering.md`.
- ‚è≥ **Real-World Assets** _(Blocked ‚Äî awaiting external licensing approvals)_: Secure licensing for Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H fixtures so synthetic payloads can be replaced and regression baselines refreshed once approvals land.
