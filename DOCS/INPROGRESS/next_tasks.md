# Next Tasks â€” DocC Catalog Follow-ups

- Expand CLI and App DocC catalogs with end-to-end tutorials and screenshots once the UI and command surfaces gain
  additional features.
- Layer DocC publishing into CI (e.g., GitHub Actions artifact upload) after validating storage and hosting
  requirements.
