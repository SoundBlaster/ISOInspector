# Next Tasks

- **In Progress:** Task D3 â€” `traf/tfhd/tfdt/trun` fragment run parsing and validation scaffolding. Track active planning in `DOCS/INPROGRESS/D3_traf_tfhd_tfdt_trun_Parsing.md` and consult `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/136_Summary_of_Work_2025-10-21_tfhd_Track_Fragment_Header/D3_traf_tfhd_tfdt_trun_Parsing.md` for the archived baseline while wiring `tfdt`/`trun` parsers plus aggregated `traf` metadata into the streaming pipeline.
- **Follow-Up:** Add integration coverage for multi-fragment assets once representative fixtures are ready so the D2 monotonic validation paths receive end-to-end exercising.
- **Pending Licensing:** Acquire real-world fixtures for Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H codecs so synthetic payloads can be replaced and snapshot baselines refreshed once licensing clears.
