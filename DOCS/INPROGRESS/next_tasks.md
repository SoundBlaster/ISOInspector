# Next Tasks â€” C4 Annotation/Bookmark Follow-ups

- Implement CoreData-backed annotation and bookmark storage and integrate with SwiftUI view models once the persistence

  strategy is finalized.

- Expand CLI and App DocC catalogs with tutorials and screenshots as new UI and command features land.
- Add DocC publishing to CI (e.g., GitHub Actions artifact uploads) after storage and hosting requirements are

  validated.
