# Next Tasks

- **Fragment Fixture Coverage:** Generate multi-`trun` samples plus negative `data_offset` and composition offset edge cases. Include fragments without `tfdt` to exercise defaulting paths before promoting fixtures into the golden set.
- **Validator & CLI Polish:** Audit downstream consumers of the fragment summaries (validators, CLI formatting) and queue any readability or diagnostics adjustments enabled by the new data.
- **Real-World Assets:** Secure licensing for Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H fixtures so synthetic payloads can be replaced and regression baselines refreshed once approvals land.
