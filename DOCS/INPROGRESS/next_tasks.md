# Next Tasks

- **In Progress:** D2 â€” `moof/mfhd` sequence number parser. See [`DOCS/INPROGRESS/D2_moof_mfhd_Sequence_Number.md`](D2_moof_mfhd_Sequence_Number.md) for scope and success criteria.
- Pending licensing: Acquire real-world fixtures for Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H codecs so synthetic payloads can be replaced and snapshot baselines refreshed once licensing clears.
