# Next Tasks

*No active research tasks beyond the items listed below.*
- üü¢ **T1.1 ‚Äî Define ParseIssue Model** _(Queued for Sprint 1 ‚Äî Tolerance Parsing)_: Implement structured corruption event model (`ParseIssue`) as foundation for tolerant parsing mode. This enables "detect, record, and continue" parsing strategy for corrupted media files. Planning documentation lives in [`DOCS/AI/Tolerance_Parsing/`](../AI/Tolerance_Parsing/README.md); see [`TODO.md`](../AI/Tolerance_Parsing/TODO.md) for full 7-phase workplan and [`ResearchSummary.md`](../AI/Tolerance_Parsing/ResearchSummary.md) for integration analysis.
- üöß **VoiceOver Regression Pass for Accessibility Shortcuts** _(In Progress ‚Äî blocked without hardware)_: Run manual VoiceOver verification on macOS and iPadOS hardware to confirm the new focus command menu announces controls and restores focus targets as expected. Tracking details now live in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/156_G8_VoiceOver_Regression_Pass_for_Accessibility_Shortcuts/G8_VoiceOver_Regression_Pass_for_Accessibility_Shortcuts.md`.
- ‚è≥ **Real-World Assets** _(Blocked ‚Äî awaiting external licensing approvals)_: Secure licensing for Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H fixtures so synthetic payloads can be replaced and regression baselines refreshed once approvals land.
- üîÑ **Snapshot & CLI Fixture Maintenance** _(Ongoing)_: Refresh snapshots and CLI fixtures whenever schema updates are intentional via `ISOINSPECTOR_REGENERATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 swift test --filter JSONExportSnapshotTests`.
