# Next Tasks

- üöß **D6 ‚Äî Sample Encryption Placeholder Parsing** _(In Progress)_: Recognize `senc`, `saio`, and `saiz` boxes during fragment parsing so the pipeline records their offsets/sizes and surfaces presence to CLI/UI consumers without attempting decryption. Context lives in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/141_Summary_of_Work_2025-10-21_Sample_Encryption/D6_Recognize_senc_saio_saiz_Placeholders.md`.
- üöß **E1 ‚Äî Enforce Parent Containment and Non-Overlap** _(In Progress)_: Extend structural validation so child boxes cannot exceed parent ranges, flagging overlapping payloads for CLI/UI surfaces; planning notes remain in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/141_Summary_of_Work_2025-10-21_Sample_Encryption/E1_Enforce_Parent_Containment_and_Non_Overlap.md`.
- ‚è≥ **Real-World Assets** _(Blocked ‚Äî awaiting external licensing approvals)_: Secure licensing for Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H fixtures so synthetic payloads can be replaced and regression baselines refreshed once approvals land.
- üöß **Codec Validation Coverage Expansion** _(In Progress ‚Äî see `DOCS/INPROGRESS/Codec_Validation_Coverage_Expansion.md`; follow-up from `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/143_E4_Verify_avcC_hvcC_Invariants/Summary_of_Work.md`)_: Expand end-to-end ParsePipeline and CLI/JSON snapshot coverage to exercise the new codec warnings alongside broader validation suite updates.
