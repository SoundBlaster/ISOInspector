# Next Tasks

- 🚧 **T3.6 — Integrity Summary Tab** _(In Progress — see `DOCS/INPROGRESS/T3_6_Integrity_Summary_Tab.md`)_:
  - Build the Integrity tab listing all `ParseIssue` entries with sort/filter controls and export actions that stay in sync with ribbons and detail panes.
- 🚧 **VoiceOver Regression Pass for Accessibility Shortcuts** _(Blocked — pending hardware)_:
  - Schedule macOS and iPadOS hardware verification to confirm focus command menus announce controls and restore focus targets. Reference `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/156_G8_VoiceOver_Regression_Pass_for_Accessibility_Shortcuts/`.
- ⏳ **Real-World Assets** _(Blocked — awaiting licensing approvals)_:
  - Secure Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H fixtures so regression baselines can shift from synthetic payloads once approvals land.
