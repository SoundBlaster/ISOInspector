# Next Tasks

- 🚧 **Validator & CLI Polish** _(In Progress — see [Validator_and_CLI_Polish.md](Validator_and_CLI_Polish.md))_: Audit downstream consumers of the new fragment fixture metadata (validators, CLI formatting, JSON export snapshots) and queue readability or diagnostics adjustments enabled by the expanded coverage.
- ⏳ **Real-World Assets** _(Blocked — awaiting external licensing approvals)_: Secure licensing for Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H fixtures so synthetic payloads can be replaced and regression baselines refreshed once approvals land.
