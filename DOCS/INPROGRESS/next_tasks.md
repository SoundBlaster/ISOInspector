# Next Tasks

- ✅ **Validator & CLI Polish** _(Completed — see [Summary_of_Work.md](Summary_of_Work.md) for verification notes)_: Validator diagnostics and CLI formatting now incorporate fragment fixture metadata, and JSON export snapshots were revalidated with the expanded coverage.
- ⏳ **Real-World Assets** _(Blocked — awaiting external licensing approvals)_: Secure licensing for Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H fixtures so synthetic payloads can be replaced and regression baselines refreshed once approvals land.
