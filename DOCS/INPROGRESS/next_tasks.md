# Next Tasks

## Metadata Follow-Up

- [ ] Expand metadata value decoding for additional data types surfaced by future fixtures so CLI exports stay aligned with MP4RA guidance. Track coverage opportunities against `DOCS/AI/ISOViewer/ISOInspector_PRD_TODO.md`. **(In Progress â€” see `DOCS/INPROGRESS/C15_Metadata_Value_Decoding_Expansion.md`.)**

## Validation Follow-Up

- [ ] Validation Rule #15. Correlate `stsc` chunk runs, `stsz/stz2` sample sizes, and `stco/co64` offsets to flag mismatches alongside the edit list duration diagnostics archived in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/122_C14c_Edit_List_Duration_Validation/`.
