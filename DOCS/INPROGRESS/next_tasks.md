# Next Tasks

- [ ] Kick off Task B4 by integrating the MP4RA metadata catalog so the streaming pipeline can resolve box definitions
  during live parsing.
- [ ] Outline additional downstream parser follow-ups unlocked now that `ParsePipeline.live()` emits real streaming events (e.g., catalog integration test coverage and fallback handling).
