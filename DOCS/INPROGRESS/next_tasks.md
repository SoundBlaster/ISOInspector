# Next Tasks

- üöß **D6 ‚Äî Sample Encryption Placeholder Parsing** _(In Progress)_: Recognize `senc`, `saio`, and `saiz` boxes during fragment parsing so the pipeline records their offsets/sizes and surfaces presence to CLI/UI consumers without attempting decryption.
- üöß **E1 ‚Äî Enforce Parent Containment and Non-Overlap** _(In Progress)_: Extend structural validation so child boxes cannot exceed parent ranges, flagging overlapping payloads for CLI/UI surfaces; context captured in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/141_Summary_of_Work_2025-10-21_Sample_Encryption/E1_Enforce_Parent_Containment_and_Non_Overlap.md`.
- ‚úÖ **E4 ‚Äî Verify avcC/hvcC Invariants** _(Completed ‚Äî see `DOCS/INPROGRESS/Summary_of_Work.md`)_:
  Codec configuration validator now enforces `lengthSizeMinusOne`, parameter-set counts, and NAL array integrity across ISOInspectorKit, ensuring CLI and JSON surfaces flag malformed entries.
- ‚úÖ **E3 ‚Äî Warn on Unusual Top-Level Ordering** _(Completed ‚Äî see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/142_E3_Warn_on_Unusual_Top_Level_Ordering/Summary_of_Work.md`)_:
  Advisory validator now warns when `ftyp` or `moov` appear in atypical top-level sequences while keeping streaming layouts non-blocking.
- ‚è≥ **Real-World Assets** _(Blocked ‚Äî awaiting external licensing approvals)_: Secure licensing for Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H fixtures so synthetic payloads can be replaced and regression baselines refreshed once approvals land.
