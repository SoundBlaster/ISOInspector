# Next Tasks

- **Completed:** D2 — `moof/mfhd` sequence number parser. See [`DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/134_D2_moof_mfhd_Sequence_Number/`](../TASK_ARCHIVE/134_D2_moof_mfhd_Sequence_Number/) for implementation details.
- **Up Next:** D3 — `traf/tfhd/tfdt/trun` parsing and validation (establish sample table scaffolding for fragment runs).
- Pending licensing: Acquire real-world fixtures for Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H codecs so synthetic payloads can be replaced and snapshot baselines refreshed once licensing clears.
