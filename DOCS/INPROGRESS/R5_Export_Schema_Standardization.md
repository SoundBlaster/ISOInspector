# R5 â€” Export Schema Standardization

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Define an export schema recommendation so ISOInspector's JSON and report outputs align with widely used MP4 inspection tools while preserving round-trip fidelity requirements.

## ðŸ§© Context
- Functional requirement **FR-CORE-004** mandates JSON and binary export capabilities with re-import verification, making schema alignment critical for interoperability. 
- The research backlog lists **R5** to compare Bento4, ffprobe, and similar report formats, aiming to map their fields onto ISOInspector exports. 
- Master PRD deliverables include export support within ISOInspectorCore, ensuring research outcomes stay tied to core product goals.

## âœ… Success Criteria
- Document a comparative analysis of at least Bento4 `mp4dump --format json`, FFmpeg/ffprobe, and any other relevant schema, highlighting coverage gaps and incompatible structures.
- Recommend a canonical ISOInspector export schema (or adaptations) with explicit field mappings and conversion notes for existing exporters.
- Identify verification steps needed so future automated tests can validate exports against the chosen schema.

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Notes
- Gather representative export samples from Bento4, ffprobe, and other reference tools to catalog field naming, typing, and nesting conventions.
- Compare samples against current ISOInspector JSON output to note missing metadata, divergent typing, or naming mismatches.
- Propose schema updates or adapters that satisfy FR-CORE-004 while minimizing breaking changes to existing CLI/UI workflows.
- Outline follow-up engineering tasks (if any) required to implement the recommended schema changes and associated regression tests.
