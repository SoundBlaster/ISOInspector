# Fragment Fixture Coverage

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Expand the fragment fixture catalog with synthetic samples that stress new `traf`/`tfhd`/`tfdt`/`trun` parsing paths so the validator, CLI, and exports exercise multi-run edge cases before the assets are promoted into the golden regression set.

## ðŸ§© Context
- Task D3 introduced fragment run aggregation and validation, calling out the need for additional fixtures that cover negative `data_offset` values, defaulted composition offsets, and multi-`trun` sequences. These follow-ups are currently listed as open items in the fragment parser archive notes and `next_tasks.md`.
- The master PRD highlights fragmented MP4 parsing and validation as core product goals, requiring representative fixtures to keep streaming scenarios reliable across CLI and UI consumers.
- Existing fixture automation (`generate_fixtures.py`) already regenerates catalogued assets with checksum enforcement, making it the preferred entry point for expanding fragment coverage.

## âœ… Success Criteria
- New fixtures capture the scenarios noted after Task D3 (multi-`trun` runs, negative `data_offset`, fragments without `tfdt`, version 0 composition offsets) and are registered in the fixture catalog with licensing metadata.
- Regression assets are wired into the Swift test suites and JSON/CLI snapshot baselines so fragment summaries and validation warnings are asserted end-to-end.
- Documentation in the fixture catalog README reflects the additional generation profiles or manifest entries required to reproduce the new assets locally.

## âœ… Outcome
- Added three synthetic fixtures (`fragmented-multi-trun`, `fragmented-negative-offset`, `fragmented-no-tfdt`) via `generate_fixtures.py` and registered them in `Tests/ISOInspectorKitTests/Fixtures/catalog.json` with updated documentation.
- Extended `FixtureCatalogExpandedCoverageTests`, `JSONExportSnapshotTests`, and the new `FragmentFixtureCoverageTests` to cover multi-run aggregation, negative `data_offset` handling, and decode-time defaulting paths.
- Refreshed fixture README guidance and created `DOCS/INPROGRESS/Summary_of_Work.md` capturing verification commands and follow-up notes.

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Notes
- Use `Tests/ISOInspectorKitTests/Fixtures/generate_fixtures.py` (and its manifest workflow) to produce deterministic fragment assets, storing large binaries under the documented fixture directories with mirrored license texts.
- Update `Documentation/FixtureCatalog/manifest.json`, `Tests/ISOInspectorKitTests/Fixtures/catalog.json`, and any related README guidance to describe the new fragment profiles and reproduction commands.
- Refresh affected test snapshots (`swift test --filter JSONExportSnapshotTests`, CLI integration tests) only after confirming the new fixtures capture the targeted edge cases without introducing unrelated regressions.
