# Monitor VR-006 Research Log Adoption

## üéØ Objective
Establish monitoring and integration checkpoints so VR-006 research log entries remain available and consistent across CLI and upcoming UI components.

## üß© Context
- Execution workplan task **B5** delivered persistent VR-006 logging shared between CLI and UI consumers, and downstream teams flagged the need to keep observing how the schema is consumed as interfaces mature.„ÄêF:DOCS/AI/ISOInspector_Execution_Guide/04_TODO_Workplan.md‚Ä†L13-L22„Äë
- Root backlog item `todo.md #3` now tracks the remaining validation follow-ups and explicitly calls out VR-006 logging as complete, making cross-surface adoption the next logical focus.„ÄêF:todo.md‚Ä†L1-L10„Äë
- CLI help text already advertises VR-006 research log streaming via the `inspect` command, so documentation and telemetry must stay accurate while UI bindings come online.„ÄêF:Sources/ISOInspectorCLI/CLI.swift‚Ä†L1-L86„Äë

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria
- Schema usage audit confirms CLI output, persisted research log files, and any UI viewer prototypes all read identical fields and severity semantics.
- Monitoring checklist created for upcoming UI milestones covering VR-006 event binding, log locations, and analyst workflows.
- Documentation updates proposed (or merged) to flag any schema adjustments required by UI components.
- No regression in existing VR-006 tests or CLI behaviors after any follow-up changes.

## üîß Implementation Notes
- Pair with UI task owners in Phase C/E to capture when components begin consuming `ParseEvent.validationIssues` for VR-006 info-level records.
- Expand automated smoke tests (or add TODOs) once UI integrations exist, ensuring research log writers and viewers remain aligned.
- Keep coordination with MP4RA catalog refresh pipeline so unknown box metadata stays correlated between validation warnings and research entries.
- Revisit archived VR-006 research logging summary for historical decisions when drafting monitoring artifacts.„ÄêF:DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/14_B5_VR006_Research_Logging/Summary_of_Work.md‚Ä†L1-L7„Äë
