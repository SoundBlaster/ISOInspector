# Summary of Work â€” C6 Codec Payload Planning

## Completed Items

- Documented the codec payload expansion roadmap covering Dolby Vision, AV1, VP9, Dolby AC-4, and MPEG-H configuration boxes in `DOCS/INPROGRESS/C6_Codec_Payload_Additions.md`, including parser models, fixtures, and validation strategies.
- Updated `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md` to close the "Monitor upcoming codec payload additions" follow-up and point future implementation to dedicated puzzles.

## Tests & Validation

- No code changes were required for this planning task; validation will occur alongside future parser implementations.

## Follow-Up Notes

- Implementation work for each codec payload will spin up individual puzzles once fixtures are staged and failing tests
  are authored.
