# Summary of Work — 2025-10-05

## Completed Tasks
- **B3 — Wire `ParsePipeline.live()` to Streaming Walker**
  - Implemented the streaming parse pipeline using an explicit stack that traverses nested MP4 boxes and emits ordered `willStartBox`/`didFinishBox` events with accurate offsets.
  - Added unit tests covering nested container traversal, large-size boxes, and error propagation to validate the live pipeline behavior.
  - Updated `todo.md` to reflect completion of the ParsePipeline streaming puzzle.

## Verification
- `swift test`
