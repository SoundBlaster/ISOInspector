# Summary of Work — Large File Performance Benchmarks Research

## Completed Tasks

- **R4 — Large File Performance Benchmarks** — Authored benchmark charter covering CLI and SwiftUI scenarios, fixture
  recipes, instrumentation matrix, and fallback plan to support F2 performance gating.

## Implementation Details

- Defined runtime and memory budgets for CLI validation, CLI streaming export, and SwiftUI streaming sessions so XCTest
  Metrics can enforce throughput expectations on 20 GB fixtures.
- Captured fixture acquisition strategy spanning synthetic fillers, fragmented stressors, vendor mirrors, and error
  fixtures with licensing notes and storage sizing guidance.
- Documented tooling matrix plus execution workflow that orchestrates fixture generation, metric harness invocation,
  Instruments capture, and regression reporting across macOS runners.
- Logged risk mitigations for hardware availability, storage pressure, toolchain drift, and flakiness, aligning with
  blocked tasks tracked in the next task list.

## Follow-Up Actions

- [ ] Schedule macOS CLI/UI benchmark execution once hardware runners are available, using the documented fixtures and
  instrumentation plan.
- [ ] Maintain release readiness and UI automation follow-ups that depend on macOS hardware to consume the new benchmark
  assets when runners are provisioned.
