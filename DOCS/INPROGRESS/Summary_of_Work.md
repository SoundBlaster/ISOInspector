# Summary of Work

## âœ… Completed Tasks

- **C7 â€” Connect bookmark diffs to persisted bookmarks.** CoreData session bookmark diff entities now resolve their

  associated bookmark records, ensuring reconciliation with Task E3's persistence layer and carrying bookmark diffs
  through session snapshots.

## ðŸ›  Implementation Highlights

- Linked `SessionBookmarkDiffEntity` rows to matching `Bookmark` entities during session saves and exposed the identifier when loading snapshots.
- Preserved bookmark diff metadata across controller persistence cycles and JSON snapshots so reconciliation data

  remains intact for CoreData and fallback stores.

- Added CoreData-facing test coverage that verifies diff linkage via managed object fetches and expanded session

  persistence tests with representative bookmark diffs.

## ðŸ§ª Verification

- `swift test --parallel`

## ðŸ—‚ Documentation & Tracking

- Marked the PDD backlog item and related PRD TODO entries as complete.
- Updated `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md` to reflect completion of Task C7.
