# Summary of Work

## Completed Tasks
- **T1.1 â€” Define ParseIssue Model**: Implemented a tolerant parsing issue model with severity, code, message, byte range, and node reference support to capture corruption events without halting traversal.

## Implementation Notes
- Added `ParseIssue` as a new validation model (`Sources/ISOInspectorKit/Validation/ParseIssue.swift`) conforming to `Codable`, `Equatable`, and `Sendable` for use across app, CLI, and export layers.
- Introduced focused unit tests (`Tests/ISOInspectorKitTests/ParseIssueTests.swift`) covering initializer behavior and JSON round-tripping.

## Verification
- `swift test --filter ParseIssueTests`

## Follow-Up
- Next sprint tasks build on the new model (`ParseTreeNode` issue storage, tolerant validation paths) per `DOCS/AI/Tolerance_Parsing/TODO.md`.
