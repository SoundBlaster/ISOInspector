# Summary of Work â€” macOS Streaming UI Automation

## Completed Tasks

- Landed `ParseTreeStreamingSelectionAutomationTests` (macOS-only) to host `ParseTreeExplorerView`, stream parse events, and

  assert the outline/detail panes synchronize around the default selection during live updates.

- Extended `ParseTreeExplorerView` with an initializer that accepts preconstructed outline/detail view models, enabling tests to

  observe production state wiring without duplicating logic.

- Updated status trackers (`DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md`, `DOCS/AI/ISOInspector_Execution_Guide/04_TODO_Workplan.md`, and

  `DOCS/AI/ISOViewer/ISOInspector_PRD_TODO.md`) plus the task note to reflect the new automation coverage.

## Testing

- `swift test` (Linux runner; macOS UI automation compiles conditionally and executes on macOS hosts.)

## Follow-Ups

- Run the new automation on a macOS host with XCTest UI support to validate the end-to-end flow against real SwiftUI
  runtime.
