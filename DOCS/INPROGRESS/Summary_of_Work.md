# Summary of Work â€” 2025-10-26

## Completed Tasks
- Phase 3.2: Implement SurfaceStyleKey Environment Key
  - Added `SurfaceStyleKey` environment key and view/environment extensions in `Sources/FoundationUI/Contexts/SurfaceStyleKey.swift`.
  - Created targeted unit tests in `Tests/FoundationUITests/ContextsTests/SurfaceStyleKeyTests.swift`.

## Implementation Highlights
- Documented the environment key with DocC-style comments and provided three SwiftUI previews for default, palette, and propagation scenarios.
- Introduced preview metrics constants to avoid magic numbers while configuring padding, spacing, and corner radius values.
- Updated `DOCS/INPROGRESS/Phase3.2_SurfaceStyleKey.md` checklists to reflect the completed work.

## Verification
- `swift test` (Linux host, SwiftUI-dependent tests compiled conditionally).

## Follow-up
- Platform-specific UI verification (iOS simulator / macOS runner) remains outstanding due to the current CI environment constraints.
