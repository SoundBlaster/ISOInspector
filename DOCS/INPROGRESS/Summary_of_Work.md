# Summary of Work — 2025-10-07

## Completed Tasks

- **12 — B5 Structural Validation (VR-001 & VR-002)**
  - Added streaming validator rules that flag headers with impossible sizes (VR-001) and container boundaries that drift
    from their declared payload (VR-002).
  - Expanded `BoxValidatorTests` to cover error, underflow, and alignment scenarios, including a regression for well-formed containers.
  - Updated the default validator pipeline so live parsing surfaces the new issues alongside existing VR-003/VR-006
    annotations.

## Validation

- `swift test`

## Follow-Up

- Continue puzzle thread for VR-004 and VR-005 ordering rules tracked under `todo.md #3`.
