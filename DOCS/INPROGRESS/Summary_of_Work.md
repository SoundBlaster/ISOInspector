# Summary of Work — 2025-10-17

## Completed Scope

- **I3 — App theming (accent palette, light/dark)**
  - Added `ISOInspectorBrandPalette` with WCAG-AA contrast coverage and unit tests to keep the palette measurable.
  - Installed a new `Assets.xcassets` catalog for the SwiftUI app with accent and surface color variants.
  - Applied an `isoInspectorAppTheme()` modifier so the app shell shares the brand accent across controls.

## Verification

- `swift test` (Linux container) covering kit, CLI, app, and new theming tests.

## Follow-Ups

- [ ] Generate production app icon raster assets from the approved vector design and wire the filenames into `AppIcon.appiconset` (`@todo` PDD:45m in `ISOInspectorAppTheme.swift`).

## Notes

- Changes synchronized with `todo.md` and `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md` to reflect the remaining icon deliverable.
