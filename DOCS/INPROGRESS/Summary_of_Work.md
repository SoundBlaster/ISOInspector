# Summary of Work â€” DocC Catalog Setup (A3)

## Completed Tasks

- Established DocC catalogs for ISOInspectorKit, ISOInspectorCLI, and ISOInspectorApp with

  architecture and workflow articles seeded for future expansion.

- Added DocC generation test coverage to enforce catalog presence and ensure the documentation

  build script remains executable.

- Introduced `scripts/generate_documentation.sh` and wired the Swift-DocC plugin dependency so

  `swift package generate-documentation` produces static-hostable archives for every target.

- Updated repository documentation (README, execution workplan) with DocC workflow details and

  ensured generated artifacts are ignored under `Documentation/DocC`.

## Verification

- `swift test`
- `./scripts/generate_documentation.sh Documentation/DocC`

## Follow-ups

- Expand CLI and App DocC catalogs with end-to-end tutorials and screenshots once the UI and command

  surfaces gain additional features.

- Layer DocC publishing into CI (e.g., GitHub Actions artifact upload) after validating storage and

  hosting requirements.
