# Summary of Work â€” 2025-10-08

## Completed Puzzle

- **17_Extend_VR006_Telemetry_UI_Smoke_Tests**
  - Added `ResearchLogTelemetryProbe` and `ResearchLogTelemetrySnapshot` to convert `ResearchLogMonitor` audits into CLI/SwiftUI telemetry diagnostics for smoke coverage.
  - Introduced `ResearchLogTelemetrySmokeTests` exercising ParsePipeline-driven success, missing log, empty log, and schema mismatch scenarios to verify VR-006 telemetry across app and CLI entry points.
  - Updated project tracking artifacts (`todo.md`, VR-006 monitoring summaries, archived next-task lists) to mark telemetry backlog item `#5` as complete and document the new coverage.

## Verification

- `swift test`

## Follow-Ups

- None. VR-006 telemetry instrumentation now covered by automated smoke tests and documentation.
