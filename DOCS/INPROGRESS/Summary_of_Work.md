## Completed Tasks

- Expanded ISOInspectorCLI DocC catalog with the **Capture Research Logs for Annotation Reviews** tutorial, including
  cross-links to app workflows and new CLI screenshot assets.
- Expanded ISOInspectorApp DocC catalog with the **Annotate and Bookmark MP4 Investigations** tutorial, covering
  annotation and bookmark persistence steps with supporting screenshots.
- Updated `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md` to reflect completion of the DocC expansion task.

## Documentation & Assets

  with new sections and fresh screenshots.
- Coordinate with CI owners to publish DocC archives that include the new tutorial content.
