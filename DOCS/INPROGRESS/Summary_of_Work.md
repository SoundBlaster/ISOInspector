# Summary of Work — 2025-10-12

## Completed Tasks

- **Route_Streaming_Export_Operations.md** — Routed the `isoinspector export` command to the shared streaming capture utilities so JSON trees and binary captures use the modern pipeline.

## Implementation Highlights

- Added ArgumentParser subcommands for `export json` and `export capture`, wiring them through `ISOInspectorCLIEnvironment.parsePipeline` and shared exporters.
- Covered success and error scenarios with new CLI tests to ensure default output paths, custom destinations, and
  failure propagation behave like the legacy runner.
- Updated project todo trackers to mark the streaming export migration as complete.

## Verification

- `swift test`

## Follow-Ups

- Surface global logging and telemetry toggles once streaming metrics are exposed to the CLI.
