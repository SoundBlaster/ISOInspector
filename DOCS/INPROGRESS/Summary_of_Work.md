# Summary of Work — 2025-10-18 Fixture Acquisition

## Completed Tasks

- **R2 Fixture Acquisition Research** — Documented ranked fixture sources with licensing notes, download pointers,
  storage sizing, and ingestion workflow guidance to unblock automation of streaming and benchmarking
  suites.【F:DOCS/INPROGRESS/R2_Fixture_Acquisition.md†L5-L88】

## Implementation Details

- Added a prioritized fixture catalog covering progressive, fragmented, metadata-heavy, and vendor-specific MP4
  families, including storage headroom recommendations for CI/macOS
  runners.【F:DOCS/INPROGRESS/R2_Fixture_Acquisition.md†L29-L88】
- Defined acquisition workflow steps (manifest schema, scripted downloads, checksum verification, license mirroring)
  aligned with existing fixture regeneration tooling.【F:DOCS/INPROGRESS/R2_Fixture_Acquisition.md†L90-L108】
- Logged follow-up PDD puzzles to extend the fixture generator and document storage locations; mirrored these in `todo.md` for scheduling.【F:DOCS/INPROGRESS/R2_Fixture_Acquisition.md†L110-L113】【F:todo.md†L40-L41】
- Updated research status trackers to mark R2 complete and referenced the new documentation
  summary.【F:DOCS/AI/ISOInspector_Execution_Guide/05_Research_Gaps.md†L9-L18】【F:DOCS/AI/ISOInspector_Execution_Guide/05_Research_Gaps.md†L23-L27】
- Recorded completion in `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md` so backlog reflects the new state.【F:DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md†L3-L6】

## Follow-Up Actions

- [ ] Implement manifest-driven fixture acquisition in `generate_fixtures.py`, ensuring checksum validation and license mirroring accompany downloads.【F:DOCS/INPROGRESS/R2_Fixture_Acquisition.md†L110-L111】
- [ ] Author fixture storage README describing mount paths and quotas for macOS runners and Linux caches once
  infrastructure is available.【F:DOCS/INPROGRESS/R2_Fixture_Acquisition.md†L112-L113】
