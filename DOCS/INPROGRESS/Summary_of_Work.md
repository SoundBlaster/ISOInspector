# Summary of Work — C16.4 Future Codec Payload Descriptors

## Completed Tasks
- **C16.4 Future codec payload descriptors** — Added typed parsers for Dolby Vision (`dvvC`), AV1 (`av1C`), VP9 (`vpcC`), Dolby AC-4 (`dac4`), and MPEG-H (`mhaC`) configuration boxes. Updated sample entry registries so new visual (`av01`, `vp09`, `vp08`, `dvav`, `dvvc`) and audio (`ac-4`, `mha1`, `mhm1`) formats participate in visual/audio parsing flows. Extended `StsdSampleDescriptionParserTests` with fixture-backed coverage for each new payload, including helper utilities for bit-level payload synthesis.

## Implementation Highlights
- Introduced `BoxParserRegistry+SampleDescriptionCodecFuture.swift` with dedicated parsing helpers that surface human-readable fields (versioning, tiers, bit depths, chroma layouts, presentation counts, compatibility flags) for export and UI consumers.
- Expanded `parseCodecSpecificFields` to wire the new helpers into existing registry logic, ensuring coverage for both clear and protected sample entries.
- Enhanced unit test builders with reusable `BitWriter` support to express packed descriptor payloads precisely.

## Testing
- `swift test` (Linux) — validates all unit, integration, and snapshot suites. See run on 2025-10-20 20:52 UTC for passing results.

## Follow-Up
- Acquire real-world fixtures for each codec to replace synthetic payloads once licensing clears, and refresh snapshot baselines accordingly.
