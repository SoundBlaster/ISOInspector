# Summary of Work — C1 Combine Bridge and State Stores

## Completed Tasks

- **C1 — Combine Bridge and State Stores:** Implemented a Combine-backed bridge that fan-outs `ParseEvent` streams to multiple subscribers and introduced a `@MainActor` parse tree store that aggregates validation issues for SwiftUI consumers.

## Implementation Highlights

- Added `ParsePipelineEventBridge` to convert `AsyncThrowingStream` pipelines into shareable Combine publishers with deterministic cancellation semantics.
- Added `ParseTreeStore` and supporting snapshot models to maintain hierarchical box trees and accumulated validation issues while staying main-actor isolated for SwiftUI updates.
- Authored new `ParseTreeStoreTests` covering bridge fan-out, tree aggregation, and failure propagation. All tests executed via `swift test`.
- Updated the execution workplan (C1 row) to record completion and the newly available SwiftUI bridge.

## Follow-Ups / Next Steps

- Tackle **C2** (tree view UI) to render the new snapshot data with search and filters.
- Plan **C3** detail and hex stores that subscribe to the same bridge and expose payload slices.
- Integrate the bridge into the SwiftUI app shell once UI scaffolding is in place.
