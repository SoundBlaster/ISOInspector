- Archived prior Integrity sorting, navigation planning, and ResearchLog preview audit notes to `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/199_T3_7_Integrity_Sorting_and_Navigation/` for historical tracking.
- Regenerated `next_tasks.md` to focus on the remaining T3.7 milestones (sorting refinements and navigation filters).
- Preserved the real-world asset licensing blocker for ongoing monitoring; no new permanent blockers identified.
