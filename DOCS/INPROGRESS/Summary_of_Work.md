# Summary of Work â€” 2025-10-10

## Completed Tasks

- C4 CoreData annotation & bookmark persistence

## Highlights

- Implemented `CoreDataAnnotationBookmarkStore` with a programmatically-defined CoreData model covering files, annotations, and bookmarks.
- Added CoreData-aware persistence tests (`AnnotationBookmarkStoreTests`) for create/update/delete/bookmark flows, including conflict handling and multi-file isolation.
- Updated developer documentation (`InterfaceOverview` DocC article and App manual) plus INPROGRESS notes to reflect the CoreData migration.
- Marked todo item #10 complete and refreshed follow-up tasks to focus on SwiftUI integration and migration planning.

## Validation

- `swift test`
- `python3 scripts/fix_markdown.py`

## Follow-ups

- Surface annotation and bookmark editing UI that uses the new store and refreshes SwiftUI view models in real time.
- Plan CoreData migrations alongside upcoming session persistence (E3) work.
