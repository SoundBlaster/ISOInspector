# Summary of Work — 2025-10-23

## Completed Tasks
- **B2 — Define BoxNode Aggregate**: Introduced the canonical ``BoxNode`` domain type in ISOInspectorKit and updated developer documentation to describe the shared tree model.

## Implementation Notes
- Added ``BoxNode`` as a sendable struct that captures headers, optional catalog metadata, parsed payload details, validation issues, and child nodes. ``ParseTree`` now stores `[BoxNode]`, and a public typealias preserves existing ``ParseTreeNode`` references.
- Extended DocC architecture notes to call out the new tree builder responsibilities and the shared ``BoxNode`` aggregate used by UI, CLI, and export layers.

## Tests & Verification
- `swift test`

## Follow-Up
- None; downstream tasks can now build on ``BoxNode`` without additional scaffolding.
