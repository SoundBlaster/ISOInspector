# Summary of Work — 2025-11-10 Archive Rotation

## Status

- Archived Task **T5.5 — Tolerant Parsing Fuzzing Harness** into `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/209_T5_5_Tolerant_Parsing_Fuzzing_Harness/` along with all supporting notes and summaries.
- Day-to-day queue remains centered on unblocking the macOS 1 GiB lenient-versus-strict benchmark rerun for Task T5.4.
- Spun up Task **T5.3 — UI Corruption Smoke Tests** to capture automation coverage for tolerant parsing UI indicators (see `DOCS/INPROGRESS/210_T5_3_UI_Corruption_Smoke_Tests.md`).

## Next Focus

- Secure macOS hardware capable of executing the 1 GiB performance fixture and run the benchmark checklist documented in `next_tasks.md`.
- Implement and stabilize the new corruption UI smoke tests described in `210_T5_3_UI_Corruption_Smoke_Tests.md`, ensuring they integrate cleanly with existing automation suites.
- Continue monitoring manual FoundationUI performance and accessibility follow-ups listed in `blocked.md` for scheduling opportunities.
