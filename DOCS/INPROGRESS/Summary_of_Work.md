# Summary of Work — 2025-10-20

## Completed Tasks

- **D2 — `moof/mfhd` Sequence Number Parser** (`DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/134_D2_moof_mfhd_Sequence_Number/`)
  - Added fragment header parsing via `ParsedBoxPayload.MovieFragmentHeaderBox` and registered `moof`/`mfhd` handlers so sequence numbers flow through the parse pipeline, JSON export, and CLI formatting.
  - Introduced validation ensuring fragment sequence numbers exist and remain monotonic across fragments, with updated fixtures and targeted tests for parser, pipeline, CLI formatting, and validators.
  - Refreshed DASH segment snapshot baselines to include decoded fragment sequence metadata and documented completion across PRD trackers.

## Validation

- `swift test`

## Notes

- Future follow-up: add integration coverage for multi-fragment assets once suitable fixtures are available to further exercise monotonic validation paths.
