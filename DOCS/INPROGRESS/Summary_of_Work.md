# Summary of Work â€” 2025-10-26

## Completed
- **T3.4 Placeholder Nodes for Missing Children**
  - Added placeholder synthesis to the parse tree builders so missing required children (e.g., `stbl` under `minf`, `tfhd` under `traf`) surface as `.corrupt` synthetic nodes with `structure.missing_child` issues that anchor into the parent byte range.
  - Updated the app store pipeline to record placeholder issues via `ParseIssueStore`, keeping ribbon metrics and Integrity views consistent across tolerant parses.
  - Extended regression coverage with `ParseExportTests.testParseTreeBuilderSynthesizesPlaceholderForMissingRequiredChild` and `ParseTreeStoreTests.testPlaceholderNodesRecordedForMissingRequiredChildren`; full `swift test` suite passes on Linux.

## Follow-ups
- Align contextual labeling (T3.5) with the new placeholder status and issue copy so outline badges and detail guidance stay consistent across corruption indicators.
