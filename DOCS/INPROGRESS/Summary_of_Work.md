# Summary of Work

## Task 13 (B5 VR-004 & VR-005 Ordering Validation)

**Completed tasks**

- Implemented VR-004 to flag media boxes that appear before the required `ftyp` declaration during live parsing.
- Implemented VR-005 to warn when `mdat` precedes `moov` outside of recognized streaming layouts.

**Implementation highlights**

- Added stateful ordering rules to `BoxValidator` so streaming events track file-type and movie box sequencing.
- Expanded live pipeline tests to cover VR-004/VR-005 violations and permitted streaming exceptions.

**Verification**

- `swift test`

**Follow-up actions**

- Execute VR-006 research logging alongside CLI and UI metadata consumption per the remaining backlog item.

**Verification**
