# Summary of Work — 2025-10-23

## Completed Tasks
- **E1 — Enforce Parent Containment and Non-Overlap**: Updated structural validation so child boxes cannot extend beyond their parent's payload range or overlap previously parsed siblings. Tracking docs now point to the archived implementation summary at `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/159_E1_Enforce_Parent_Containment_and_Non_Overlap/Summary_of_Work.md`.

## Implementation Highlights
- Extended the `ContainerBoundaryRule` stack accounting to compare each child start/end offset against its parent, emitting VR-002 errors for overlaps and parent-range overflows.
- Added targeted `BoxValidatorTests` to exercise overflowing and overlapping child fixtures, ensuring VR-002 now surfaces actionable diagnostics for each violation.
- Propagated completion markers across the workplan, PRD backlog, and historical `next_tasks.md` rollups while archiving the in-progress brief under `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/159_E1_Enforce_Parent_Containment_and_Non_Overlap/`.

## Verification
- `swift test --filter BoxValidatorTests`

## Follow-Up
- Continue expanding malformed fixture coverage once new real-world samples become available (tracked under "Real-World Assets" backlog items).
