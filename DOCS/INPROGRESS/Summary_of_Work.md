# Summary of Work — 2025-10-24

## Completed Tasks
- **T1.6 — Implement Binary Reader Guards**: Updated `StreamingBoxWalker` to clamp traversal to the active parent range and translate `BoxHeaderDecodingError.exceedsParent`/`.exceedsReader` outcomes into `payload.truncated` issues with clamped byte ranges. Added focused regression coverage in `StreamingBoxWalkerTests` to exercise tolerant parsing on truncated child payloads.

## Verification
- `swift test --filter StreamingBoxWalkerTests`

## Follow-Up Notes
- Proceed to **T1.7** once progress and depth guard requirements are finalized.
