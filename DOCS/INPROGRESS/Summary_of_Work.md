# Summary of Work — 2025-10-24

## Completed Tasks
- **Traversal Guard Implementation** — Added forward-progress, zero-length flood, recursion depth, cursor regression, and per-node issue budget enforcement in `StreamingBoxWalker`, completing the follow-up to T1.7.

## Implementation Highlights
- Extended `ParsePipeline.Options` with traversal guard thresholds (`maxTraversalDepth`, `maxStalledIterationsPerFrame`, `maxZeroLengthBoxesPerParent`, `maxIssuesPerFrame`) and refreshed strict/tolerant presets.
- Hardened `StreamingBoxWalker` to enforce traversal guards, emit scoped `ParseIssue` diagnostics for each guard, and coordinate issue budgets, while ensuring tolerant mode skips corrupt structures without regressing strict behavior.
- Updated `ParseTreeBuilder` so guard issues automatically mark affected nodes as `.partial`, keeping parse-tree snapshots aligned with corruption reports.
- Added regression tests for zero-length flood handling, recursion depth caps, and option defaults.

## Verification
- `swift test --filter StreamingBoxWalkerTests`
- `swift test`

## Follow-Ups
- Surface new guard issue codes in CLI/app presentations alongside tolerant parsing summaries (`next_tasks.md` entry: "Tolerant Parsing — Surface Issues in Downstream Consumers").
- Capture guard telemetry once aggregation dashboards are in place, as outlined in `DOCS/AI/Tolerance_Parsing/Traversal_Guard_Requirements.md`.
