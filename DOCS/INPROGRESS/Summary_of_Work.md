# Summary of Work — Task D3 (Track Fragment Parsing)

## Completed
- Registered `tfdt`, `trun`, and `traf` parsers in `BoxParserRegistry`, introducing fragment environment plumbing that feeds resolved defaults into structured payloads.
- Added typed models for track fragment decode time, run entries, and aggregated fragment summaries with JSON and CLI formatting coverage.
- Extended validation with VR-017 fragment run checks and refreshed the DASH segment snapshot to surface fragment metadata in exports.

## Tests
- `swift test` (all targets) — confirms parser/validator/CLI updates pass the full suite.
- `swift test --filter JSONExportSnapshotTests/testDashSegmentSnapshotMatchesFixture` — verified regenerated snapshot matches the new schema.

## Documentation & Tracking
- Marked Task D3 as complete in `todo.md` and `DOCS/AI/ISOViewer/ISOInspector_PRD_TODO.md`.
- Updated `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md` with follow-up coverage goals and fixture needs.

## Follow-Up Ideas
- Add fixtures covering negative `data_offset` values, version 0 composition offsets, and multi-`trun` fragments to harden the aggregator.
- Audit CLI formatting once real-world DASH/HLS assets are available to ensure summaries remain readable under sparse metadata.
