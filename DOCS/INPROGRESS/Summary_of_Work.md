# Summary of Work — 2025-10-27

## 2025-10-25 – FoundationUI BoxTreePattern Completion
- Finalized `BoxTreePattern` SwiftUI implementation with DS token-driven styling, accessibility announcements, and selection binding sync.
- Introduced `BoxTreeController` logic with Linux-compatible observable wrappers plus comprehensive unit tests for expansion, selection, indentation, and large dataset handling.
- Authored foundational Design System token scaffolding (spacing, colors, typography, radius, animation, opacity) to eliminate magic numbers across the new pattern.

### Verification
- `swift test`

### Follow-Up
- Validate SwiftUI previews and snapshot coverage on Apple toolchains; extend accessibility VoiceOver smoke tests when hardware runners are available.

## Completed Tasks
- **T2.3 — Aggregate Parse Issue Metrics for UI and CLI Ribbons**
  - Extended `ParseIssueStore` with `metricsSnapshot()` and `makeIssueSummary()` so SwiftUI ribbons and CLI flows can fetch per-severity counts, totals, and deepest affected depth without recomputing the store.
  - Updated tolerant parsing documentation (`DOCS/AI/Tolerance_Parsing/TODO.md`, `IntegrationSummary.md`, and execution workplan) to reference the new aggregation APIs.
  - Added test coverage in `ParseIssueStoreTests` for severity dictionaries, background snapshots, and summary DTOs.

## Verification
- `swift test --filter ParseIssueStoreTests`
- `swift test`

## Follow-Up
- `@todo PDD:45m` in `Sources/ISOInspectorApp/State/ParseTreeStore.swift` remains open to surface the new metrics in SwiftUI once ribbon specs land.
