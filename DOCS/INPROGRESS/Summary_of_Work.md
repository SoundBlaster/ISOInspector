# Summary of Work — 2025-10-13

## Completed Tasks

- **Task D4 — CLI batch mode and CSV summary export.**
  - Added the `isoinspect batch` subcommand to expand input lists, stream validation for each file, and emit aggregated status tables with CI-friendly exit codes.
  - Introduced `BatchValidationSummary` utilities to render aligned console summaries and CSV payloads, ensuring deterministic ordering and totals.
  - Updated DocC command reference to document both single-file and batch validation workflows.
  - Captured regression coverage for the batch command, verifying CSV generation and exit-code semantics.

## Verification

- `swift test --filter ISOInspectorCommandTests/testBatchCommandAggregatesResultsAndWritesCSV`
- `swift test`

## Notes

- Unmatched glob patterns print diagnostics while continuing to process other resolved files so batch invocations remain
  resilient.
