# Summary of Work — 2025-11-07

## Status

- Archived the CLI corruption summary task notes into `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/208_T6_2_CLI_Corruption_Summary_Output/` after landing the tolerant-mode metrics output.
- Day-to-day queue now centers on unblocking the macOS 1 GiB lenient-versus-strict benchmark rerun for Task T5.4.

## Notes

- Keep the CLI corruption summary snapshot references in the archive folder for regression investigations; new CLI-related follow-ups should start fresh stubs under `DOCS/INPROGRESS/` as they arise.
- Reconfirm backlog callouts (`todo.md`, execution workplan, PRD TODO) reference the new archive location for Task T6.2 so future contributors can trace the implementation notes quickly.

## Active Deliverables

- **T5.4 — macOS Benchmark Rerun**: Awaiting hardware availability before executing the lenient-versus-strict performance run.
