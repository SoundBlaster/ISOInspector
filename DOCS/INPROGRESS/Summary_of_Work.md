# Summary of Work — 2025-10-12

## Completed Tasks

- **D2 — Implement `inspect` and `validate` commands with streaming output.**
  - Added asynchronous subcommands backed by `ISOInspectorCLIEnvironment` so the new Swift ArgumentParser entry point streams parse events, produces VR-006 research logs, and aggregates validation outcomes.
  - Extended CLI tests to cover the new commands, ensuring research log integration and severity-based exit codes.

## Verification

- `swift test`

## Follow-Ups

- Surface global logging and telemetry toggles once streaming metrics are exposed via the CLI.
- Route export operations to the shared streaming capture utilities as part of the remaining CLI migration work.
