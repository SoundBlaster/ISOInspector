## 2025-10-29 â€” ResearchLogMonitor Preview Audit Closure

- Retired the PDD puzzle in `ResearchLogMonitor.audit` now that SwiftUI preview pipelines execute the audit via `ResearchLogPreviewProvider` snapshots.
- Updated `todo.md`, `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md`, and archive next-task trackers to mark #4 as complete with cross-references to the verification notes.
- Captured completion summaries in the active task brief (`DOCS/INPROGRESS/194_ResearchLogMonitor_SwiftUIPreviews.md`) and related archive entries to document fixture health and diagnostic coverage.
- CI-equivalent Swift tests were not executed in this Linux container because the preview-oriented suites require Apple toolchains; rely on existing `ResearchLogPreviewProviderTests` and `ResearchLogAccessibilityIdentifierTests` during macOS verification.
