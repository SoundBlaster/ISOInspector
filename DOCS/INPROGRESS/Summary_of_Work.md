# Summary of Work — 2025-10-22

## Completed Tasks
- **B7 — Validation Rule Preset Configuration**
  - Added `ValidationRuleIdentifier`, `ValidationPreset`, and `ValidationConfiguration` to ISOInspectorKit so validation rule toggles have a shared Codable configuration model.
  - Bundled `ValidationPresets.json` with "All Checks Enabled" and "Structural Focus" presets and shipped loader helpers exercised by new unit coverage.
  - Verified manifest loading, override behavior, and identifier coverage via `swift test` (`ValidationConfigurationTests`).

## Follow-up Actions
- [ ] Wire preset selection flags through ISOInspectorCLI (task D7) and propagate configuration summaries to CLI output.
- [ ] Persist user-authored presets inside ISOInspectorApp (task C19) with Application Support storage and settings UI.
- [ ] Extend validation export metadata (CLI, JSON, session state) to record the active preset identifier and disabled rule IDs.
