# Summary of Work â€” Metadata Validation and Reporting

## Completed Tasks

- Added validation models and integrated `BoxValidator` into `ParsePipeline.live()` so stream events surface MP4RA-driven warnings when version/flags diverge and unknown boxes appear.
- Introduced a reusable CLI `EventConsoleFormatter` that prints catalog names, summaries, and validation outcomes for each `ParseEvent` to prepare downstream `inspect` tooling.
- Captured follow-up puzzle `@todo #3` for implementing the remaining validation rules and documented CLI wiring needs in `DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md`.

## Testing

- `swift test`

## Notes

- Unknown box encounters now raise VR-006 research issues while continuing to log through `DiagnosticsLogger` for catalog refresh workflows.
- CLI output leverages the shared box identifier string helper so both SwiftUI and CLI layers can display consistent
  identifiers.
