# Summary of Work — 2025-10-10

## Completed Puzzles

- **#9 — CLI Export Commands** (`DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/29_D3_CLI_Export_Commands/`): Implemented `export-json` and `export-capture` subcommands, updated help output, and shipped tests that verify JSON parity and capture round-tripping.

## Highlights

- Added CLI argument parsing and output validation to stream parse events into `ParseTreeBuilder`, `JSONParseTreeExporter`, and `ParseEventCaptureEncoder` for deterministic exports.
- Extended CLI test coverage to assert default output paths, help messaging, and exporter interoperability using `ParseEventCaptureDecoder`.
- Archived task documentation and synchronized cross-references across `todo.md`, workplan tables, and prior follow-up notes.

## Verification

- `swift test`

## Pending Follow-Ups

- None — awaiting new assignments (next workstream is CLI batch mode D4).
