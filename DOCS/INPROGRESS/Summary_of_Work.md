# Summary of Work — T3.5 Contextual Status Labels

## Completed Tasks
- **T3.5 Contextual Status Labels** — Surfaced tolerant parsing status chips in the outline rows and detail inspector so invalid, partial, corrupted, trimmed, and related node states are visible at a glance.

## Implementation Notes
- Added a shared `ParseTreeStatusDescriptor` model plus `ParseTreeStatusBadge` SwiftUI view, wiring the outline row and detail inspector to render synchronized badges.
- Extended tolerant parsing status enums to cover future states (`invalid`, `empty`, `trimmed`) and updated Outline view models/tests to propagate descriptors through row snapshots.
- Replaced the detail metadata status row with a badge presentation and mirrored the same badge alongside the corruption issue section header for consistency.

## Verification
- `swift test` (Linux container) — 358 tests executed, 0 failures, 1 skipped (Combine benchmark). See execution log for details.
