# C14c ‚Äî Edit List Duration Reconciliation

## üéØ Objective

Ensure edit list payloads participate in validation so presentation durations align with movie and track headers, flagging gaps, overlaps, and unsupported rate adjustments surfaced by the `elst` parser.

## üß© Context

- Builds on the scoped reconciliation rules for `edts/elst` captured during Task C14a, covering duration sums, empty edits, and rate sanity requirements. „ÄêF:DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/120_C14a_Finalize_Edit_List_Scope/C14a_Finalize_Edit_List_Scope.md‚Ä†L1-L74„Äë„ÄêF:DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/120_C14a_Finalize_Edit_List_Scope/C14a_Finalize_Edit_List_Scope.md‚Ä†L89-L119„Äë
- Leverages the streaming edit list entries emitted by Task C14b so validation can normalize segments using movie and

  media timescales without re-reading payloads.

- Aligns with the execution workplan priority that Phase C validation follow-ups unblock downstream fixture refreshes

  and CLI exports.

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

- Validation compares summed edit list movie durations against `mvhd.duration` and reports discrepancies exceeding one tick of the movie timescale.
- Track-level reconciliation maps non-empty edits into media timescale units and surfaces drift relative to `tkhd` and `mdhd` durations, tolerating disabled tracks.
- Diagnostics call out overlapping presentation windows, unsupported reverse/paused segments, and non-zero `media_rate_fraction` values with actionable messages.
- Results flow into CLI/JSON exports and existing UI diagnostic channels without regressing current tests.

## üîß Implementation Notes

- Extend the validation pipeline added in prior Phase C work to consume `elst` entries alongside `mvhd`, `tkhd`, and `mdhd` metadata; reuse cumulative presentation offsets computed by the parser.
- Emit structured diagnostics tagged with affected track IDs so future fixture updates (C14d) can assert expected

  messaging across empty, offset, and rate-adjusted scenarios.

- Add targeted regression coverage that exercises empty edits, multi-segment offsets, and mismatched durations using

  existing fixture corpus until refreshed baselines land.

- Coordinate with Validation Rule #15 planning to ensure sample table cross-checks can incorporate edit list timing once

  chunk alignment logic is available.
