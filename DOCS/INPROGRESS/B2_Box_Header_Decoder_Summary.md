# B2 Progress Summary â€” Box Header Decoder

## Completed Outcomes
- Added big-endian decoding helpers to `RandomAccessReader` for 32-bit, 64-bit, and FourCC values with error reporting on short reads.
- Introduced `FourCharCode` value type and `BoxHeader` model representing header metadata including payload range and optional UUID.
- Implemented `BoxHeaderDecoder.readHeader` to handle standard, largesize, `uuid`, and zero-sized boxes while validating parent/file bounds.
- Expanded the XCTest suite with dedicated fixtures covering nominal and malformed headers plus helper behavior.

## Testing Snapshot
- `swift test`

## Follow-Ups
- B2+: Evaluate exposing async streaming interfaces once higher parser layers require progressive reads.
