# B4 Follow-Up Planning ‚Äî Catalog Integration Coverage

## üéØ Objective

Outline the concrete follow-up tasks unlocked by the MP4RA catalog integration so the parser, validators, and downstream
consumers gain full metadata-aware coverage and fallbacks.

## üß© Context

- Task B4 in the execution workplan prioritizes integrating the MP4RA metadata catalog once streaming parse events are
  in place, and highlights the need for graceful handling of unknown
  boxes.„ÄêF:DOCS/AI/ISOInspector_Execution_Guide/04_TODO_Workplan.md‚Ä†L18-L30„Äë
- The technical specification describes how `ParsePipeline` should consult `BoxCatalog` to enrich events and enable validation/reporting layers to surface descriptive metadata.„ÄêF:DOCS/AI/ISOInspector_Execution_Guide/03_Technical_Spec.md‚Ä†L12-L40„Äë
- The PRD backlog calls for metadata-driven validation and reporting so CLI/UI surfaces human-readable context and
  captures mismatches against MP4RA
  definitions.„ÄêF:DOCS/AI/ISOInspector_Execution_Guide/03_Technical_Spec.md‚Ä†L41-L73„Äë„ÄêF:DOCS/AI/ISOViewer/ISOInspector_PRD_TODO.md‚Ä†L70-L108„Äë

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

- Produce a prioritized checklist of downstream B4 follow-up tasks (tests, fallbacks, consumer updates) with
  dependencies and expected artifacts.
- Identify required fixtures and catalog scenarios (standard, UUID, unknown types) and document how they will be
  exercised in automation.
- Specify how validation and reporting layers (CLI/UI/export) should consume catalog metadata, including acceptance
  signals for graceful degradation when descriptors are missing.
- Capture any open risks or external research needed before implementation begins.

## üîß Implementation Notes

- Leverage existing `ParsePipeline.live()` event coverage to define integration test hooks for metadata assertions and fallback logging.
- Coordinate with validation rule backlog (VR-003, VR-006) so catalog mismatches and unknown box tracking align with
  success criteria.
- Call out tooling or data needs (e.g., fixture MP4 files with custom UUID boxes) and whether new scripts must be added to `scripts/`.
- Ensure proposed follow-ups map cleanly to workplan phases (e.g., B4 extensions before B5 validation or D2 CLI wiring)
  to maintain dependency order.
