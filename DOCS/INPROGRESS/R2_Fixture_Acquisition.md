# R2 Fixture Acquisition

## üéØ Objective

Identify and document a curated catalog of MP4/QuickTime fixtures that exercise standard, fragmented, and
vendor-specific atoms so the parsing, validation, and benchmarking suites can rely on representative media samples.

## ‚úÖ Summary

- Curated ten high-value fixture sources spanning progressive, fragmented, high-bitrate, metadata-rich, and
  vendor-specific MP4 variants.
- Captured licensing, redistribution allowances, download locations, checksum strategies, and approximate storage
  requirements for each source so automation can stage media safely.
- Outlined ingestion, verification, and storage workflows that align with existing fixture regeneration tooling and
  document any macOS-dependent follow-up actions.

## üß© Context

- Research backlog R2 prioritizes gathering legally distributable media covering a wide atom surface, including DASH
  fragments and vendor boxes, to unblock QA and benchmarking
  coverage.„ÄêF:DOCS/AI/ISOInspector_Execution_Guide/05_Research_Gaps.md‚Ä†L8-L16„Äë
- Performance and validation workflows in the execution plan depend on diverse fixtures to exercise streaming readers,
  benchmarks, and follow-up hardware validation work once macOS infrastructure is
  available.„ÄêF:DOCS/AI/ISOInspector_Execution_Guide/04_TODO_Workplan.md‚Ä†L18-L47„Äë„ÄêF:DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md‚Ä†L5-L12„Äë

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

- Produce a ranked list of sample sources (public datasets, vendor bundles) with licensing notes and download
  metadata.„ÄêF:DOCS/AI/ISOInspector_Execution_Guide/05_Research_Gaps.md‚Ä†L8-L16„Äë
- Ensure the catalog covers core MP4 families (progressive `moov`/`mdat`), fragmented streaming (`moof`/`traf`), metadata-heavy assets, and edge cases referenced in benchmarking runbooks.„ÄêF:DOCS/AI/ISOInspector_Execution_Guide/04_TODO_Workplan.md‚Ä†L18-L47„Äë
- Document storage and size requirements so CI or hardware runners can stage the media without exhausting
  quotas.„ÄêF:DOCS/AI/ISOInspector_Execution_Guide/05_Research_Gaps.md‚Ä†L8-L16„Äë

| 4 | GPAC DASH Dataset | Extensive CMAF live/on-demand sets with large `mdat` chunks, multi-language tracks, and MPD variations that stress parser heuristics. | GNU LGPL for tooling; media licensed under CC-BY per dataset README. | http://download.tsi.telecom-paristech.fr/gpac/dataset/dash/ (mirror `dash-vod`, `dash-live`, and `dash-lowlatency`). | ~5 GB for representative sets. |
| 5 | Blender Foundation Open Movies | High-bitrate cinematic MP4 renders (Big Buck Bunny, Sintel, Tears of Steel) featuring large `co64` tables, alternate edits, and metadata-laden `udta`. | Creative Commons Attribution 3.0/4.0 ‚Äî redistribution permitted with credit. | https://media.xiph.org/mango/ and https://download.blender.org/peach/bigbuckbunny_movies/ (prefer MP4/H.264, H.265 exports). | ~12 GB if mirroring 1080p/4K masters. |
| 6 | Xiph.Org Test Media | Speech, music, and synthetic clips across container variants; includes intentionally malformed/truncated MP4 samples. | Creative Commons Attribution/ShareAlike depending on asset; redistribution allowed with notice. | https://media.xiph.org/video/derf/ (filter `.mp4`, `.m4v`). | ~3 GB for curated subset including malformed cases. |

| 10 | ISO/IEC ISOBMFF Reference Files | Official conformance files with edge-case atoms (e.g., `seig`, `leva`, `colr`); critical for validation rule regressions. | Distributed under ISO Sample License allowing use within conformance tooling; keep metadata README bundled. | https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c061807_ISO_IEC_14496-15_2019.zip and associated sample packs. | ~0.8 GB unpacked. |

### Prioritization Guidance

1. Mirror Apple, DASH-IF, Bento4, and ISO reference assets first ‚Äî they unlock CLI validation, DocC guides, and
   regression tests referenced across the execution plan
   phases.„ÄêF:DOCS/AI/ISOInspector_Execution_Guide/04_TODO_Workplan.md‚Ä†L18-L47„Äë
1. Follow with Blender/Xiph corpora to feed benchmarking suites that stress large `mdat` payloads and random-slice workloads.
1. Stage vendor telemetry sources (GoPro, DJI) once metadata extraction tasks exit `todo.md` backlog, ensuring license texts ship alongside fixtures.

## üì¶ Acquisition & Verification Workflow

1. **Create staging manifest** (`Documentation/FixtureCatalog/manifest.json` ‚Äî new file in follow-up task) capturing source URL, SHA-256 checksum, license snippet, and coverage tags (`progressive`, `fragmented`, `vendor`, `malformed`).
1. **Download via scripted helper** ‚Äî extend `Tests/ISOInspectorKitTests/Fixtures/generate_fixtures.py` to accept manifest input and emit deterministic filenames. Store large assets under `Distribution/Fixtures/<category>/` while keeping lightweight regression fixtures inside the test bundle.„ÄêF:Tests/ISOInspectorKitTests/Fixtures/README.md‚Ä†L6-L49„Äë
1. **Checksum validation** ‚Äî log digests in Git-tracked manifest so CI runners can verify integrity before copying to
   ephemeral scratch disks.
1. **Storage targets** ‚Äî allocate 40 GB on macOS runners (post-download footprint ‚âà 37 GB) and 15 GB on Linux CI for a
   curated subset excluding cinema-scale masters. Documented sizes include 20% headroom.
1. **Redistribution compliance** ‚Äî mirror each license text under `Documentation/FixtureCatalog/licenses/` and reference it from the manifest to satisfy attribution requirements.

## üöß Follow-Up Tasks

- <!-- @todo PDD:45m Wire generate_fixtures.py to ingest manifest-driven remote downloads, including checksum
  verification and license mirroring. -->
- <!-- @todo PDD:30m Produce fixture storage README describing mount paths for macOS runners and Linux CI caches once
  infrastructure lands. -->

## üîß Implementation Notes

- Audit existing archives and public collections (Apple sample media, DASH-IF, vendor-provided files) for coverage,
  recording checksum, codecs, and notable boxes before
  inclusion.„ÄêF:DOCS/AI/ISOInspector_Execution_Guide/05_Research_Gaps.md‚Ä†L8-L16„Äë
- Capture follow-up actions for fixtures that require macOS hardware to validate streaming automation once runners exist, keeping `next_tasks.md` aligned with any hardware-dependent execution steps.„ÄêF:DOCS/INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md‚Ä†L5-L21„Äë
- Coordinate with benchmarking documentation to align selected samples with the random-slice and Combine UI benchmark
  plans so the datasets serve both CLI and UI
  workflows.„ÄêF:DOCS/AI/ISOInspector_Execution_Guide/04_TODO_Workplan.md‚Ä†L18-L47„Äë
