# PDD:45m Manifest-Driven Fixture Acquisition

## üéØ Objective

Implement manifest-driven remote fixture acquisition so `generate_fixtures.py` can download, verify, and catalog large media assets required for benchmarking and validation.

## üß© Context

- The fixture acquisition research catalog defines prioritized sources, licensing requirements, checksum expectations,

  and storage targets that the automation must honor when mirroring
  assets.„ÄêF:DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/84_R2_Fixture_Acquisition/R2_Fixture_Acquisition.md‚Ä†L34-L72„Äë

- The existing fixture generation script currently rebuilds synthetic fixtures but does not ingest external media or

  manage license mirroring, leaving benchmark and QA workflows
  manual.„ÄêF:Tests/ISOInspectorKitTests/Fixtures/README.md‚Ä†L6-L49„Äë

- Execution planning emphasizes completing fixture automation to unblock pending benchmark and release readiness work
  once macOS hardware is available, so we should prepare the manifest tooling ahead of runner availability.„ÄêF:DOCS/AI/ISOInspector_Execution_Guide/04_TODO_Workplan.md‚Ä†L18-L47„Äë„ÄêF:DOCS/AI/ISOInspector_Execution_Guide/04_TODO_Workplan.md‚Ä†L164-L171„Äë

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

- `Tests/ISOInspectorKitTests/Fixtures/generate_fixtures.py` accepts a manifest describing remote assets, downloads each entry, verifies SHA-256 checksums, and writes deterministic filenames under the documented storage structure.
- The script copies or references license texts for each source into `Documentation/FixtureCatalog/licenses/` so redistribution requirements are met.
- A tracked manifest (e.g., `Documentation/FixtureCatalog/manifest.json`) records URLs, checksums, coverage tags, and license references for CI/hardware runners.
- Script output logs clearly indicate download status, verification results, and storage paths to aid future automation and troubleshooting.

## üîß Implementation Notes

- Extend the Python script with a manifest loader, streaming download helpers (with resume-friendly temp files), and
  checksum validation; reuse existing fixture catalog patterns for deterministic naming.„ÄêF:DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/84_R2_Fixture_Acquisition/R2_Fixture_Acquisition.md‚Ä†L57-L65„Äë

- Mirror each source license into a dedicated directory and link it from the manifest entry to satisfy attribution
  requirements before bundling fixtures with runners.„ÄêF:DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/84_R2_Fixture_Acquisition/R2_Fixture_Acquisition.md‚Ä†L61-L72„Äë

- Stage large assets outside the test bundle under `Distribution/Fixtures/` while keeping lightweight regression assets in-repo; document mount paths in the follow-up README task to align with storage guidance.„ÄêF:DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/84_R2_Fixture_Acquisition/R2_Fixture_Acquisition.md‚Ä†L57-L72„Äë
- Consider adding a dry-run mode that validates checksums and license availability without downloading to support CI

  gating.
