// swift-tools-version: 6.0
import SwiftUI

/// Design System Animation Tokens
///
/// Provides consistent, accessible animation timings for the FoundationUI framework.
/// All animations respect the system's Reduce Motion accessibility setting.
///
/// ## Usage
/// ```swift
/// @State private var isExpanded = false
///
/// VStack {
///     // ...
/// }
/// .animation(DS.Animation.quick, value: isExpanded)
///
/// Button("Toggle") {
///     withAnimation(DS.Animation.medium) {
///         isExpanded.toggle()
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Accessibility
/// All animation tokens automatically respect `preferredReduceMotion`:
/// - When Reduce Motion is **disabled**: Normal animations play
/// - When Reduce Motion is **enabled**: Animations are instant (duration â†’ 0)
///
/// ## Tokens
/// - `quick`: Fast, snappy animations for immediate feedback (0.15s)
/// - `medium`: Standard animations for most UI transitions (0.25s)
/// - `slow`: Slower animations for complex state changes (0.35s)
///
/// ## Design Rationale
/// - **quick**: Used for button presses, hover states, immediate visual feedback
/// - **medium**: Used for panel transitions, expand/collapse, most UI changes
/// - **slow**: Reserved for complex transitions like navigation, modal presentations
///
/// ## Platform Considerations
/// - iOS: Animations feel responsive and fluid
/// - macOS: Slightly snappier to match desktop expectations
/// - Both platforms respect user preferences for motion
