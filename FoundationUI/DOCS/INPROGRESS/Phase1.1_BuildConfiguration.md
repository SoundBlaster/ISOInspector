## üîß Implementation Notes

### Swift Compiler Settings

Add to `FoundationUI/Package.swift`:

```swift
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "FoundationUI",
        dependencies: [],
        swiftSettings: [
            .enableUpcomingFeature("StrictConcurrency"),
            .unsafeFlags(["-warnings-as-errors"], .when(configuration: .release))
        ]
    ),
    // ...
]
```

### Build Scripts

Create `FoundationUI/Scripts/build.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "üî® Building FoundationUI..."
swift build

echo "‚úÖ Running tests..."
swift test --enable-code-coverage

echo "üîç Checking SwiftLint..."
swiftlint --strict

echo "üìä Generating coverage report..."
xcrun llvm-cov report .build/debug/FoundationUIPackageTests.xctest/Contents/MacOS/FoundationUIPackageTests \
  -instr-profile .build/debug/codecov/default.profdata \
  -ignore-filename-regex=".build|Tests"

echo "‚úÖ All checks passed!"
```

### Code Coverage Configuration

For Xcode projects, add to scheme settings:
- Enable "Gather coverage for all targets"
- Set coverage target to 80%

For SPM, use `swift test --enable-code-coverage` and analyze with `llvm-cov`.

### CI/CD Integration

Example GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/foundationui.yml`):

```yaml
name: FoundationUI CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
    paths:
      - 'FoundationUI/**'
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
    paths:
      - 'FoundationUI/**'

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: macos-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Select Xcode version
      run: sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode_15.0.app

    - name: SwiftLint
      run: |
        cd FoundationUI
        swiftlint --strict

    - name: Build
      run: |
        cd FoundationUI
        swift build

    - name: Run Tests
      run: |
        cd FoundationUI
        swift test --enable-code-coverage

    - name: Generate Coverage Report
      run: |
        cd FoundationUI
        xcrun llvm-cov export -format="lcov" \
          .build/debug/FoundationUIPackageTests.xctest/Contents/MacOS/FoundationUIPackageTests \
          -instr-profile .build/debug/codecov/default.profdata \
          > coverage.lcov

    - name: Upload Coverage
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
      with:
        files: ./FoundationUI/coverage.lcov
        fail_ci_if_error: true
```

## üìã Implementation Checklist

### Part 1: Compiler Configuration
- [ ] Read current `Package.swift` configuration
- [ ] Add `swiftSettings` with strict concurrency
- [ ] Add warnings-as-errors flag for release builds
- [ ] Test build with new settings (requires macOS)
- [ ] Document compiler flags and their purpose

### Part 2: Build Scripts
- [ ] Create `Scripts/` directory
- [ ] Write `build.sh` script
- [ ] Write `coverage.sh` script
- [ ] Make scripts executable (`chmod +x`)
- [ ] Test scripts locally (requires macOS)
- [ ] Add script usage to documentation

### Part 3: CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] Research project's current CI setup
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow file
- [ ] Configure workflow to run on FoundationUI changes
- [ ] Add SwiftLint step
- [ ] Add build and test steps
- [ ] Add coverage reporting step
- [ ] Test workflow (requires GitHub repository push)

### Part 4: Code Coverage
- [ ] Enable code coverage in Package.swift settings
- [ ] Set coverage threshold to 80%
- [ ] Generate initial coverage report
- [ ] Verify current coverage percentage
- [ ] Document how to view coverage locally
- [ ] Integrate coverage with CI reporting

- [ ] Document required tools (Xcode, SwiftLint)
- [ ] Document build commands
- [ ] Document coverage commands
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section
- [ ] Update main README with build badge (optional)

### Part 6: Verification

- [ ] Verify SwiftLint passes with strict mode
- [ ] Confirm test suite runs
- [ ] Verify coverage meets 80% threshold
- [ ] Test on clean macOS environment (if possible)
- [ ] Update Task Plan with completion marker

### Part 7: Finalization
- [ ] Commit all configuration files
- [ ] Update `next_tasks.md` with next priorities
- [ ] Archive this task document
- [ ] Create summary of work

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Platform Considerations

- **Linux**: Swift compiler available, but SwiftUI tests won't run
- **macOS**: Full toolchain required for testing and coverage
- **CI/CD**: Use macOS runners for complete validation

## üéØ Expected Outcomes

After completing this task:

1. **Strict Quality Gates**: Code cannot be merged without passing SwiftLint and tests
2. **Automated Testing**: CI runs full test suite on every commit
3. **Coverage Visibility**: Team can see code coverage metrics
4. **Reproducible Builds**: Build scripts ensure consistent build process
5. **Documentation**: New developers can set up and build the project easily

## üìä Quality Metrics

- SwiftLint violations: 0 (enforced)
- Test coverage: ‚â•80% (enforced)
- Build success rate: 100% (CI enforced)
- Documentation completeness: 100%

## üîÑ Next Tasks After Completion

With build configuration complete, Phase 1.1 will be 100% finished. According to the task plan:

- **Phase 1**: Move to remaining Phase 1 tasks (if any)
- **Phase 3**: Continue with Pattern implementations (7/16 tasks)
- **Phase 4**: Begin Agent Support & Polish work

Refer to `next_tasks.md` for specific next priorities.
