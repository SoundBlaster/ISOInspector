# Phase 3 – BoxTreePattern (Completed 2025-10-25)

## Task Summary
- **Phase:** 3.1 Layer 3 – UI Patterns
- **Priority:** P1
- **Task:** Implement `BoxTreePattern`
- **Date Started:** 2025-10-26
- **Date Completed:** 2025-10-25 (Linux implementation validated)
- **Owner:** FoundationUI Agent

## Dependencies Check
- ✅ Layer 0 Design Tokens (Spacing, Colors, Typography, Radius, Animation) defined in Phase 1 Task Plan scope
- ✅ Layer 1 View Modifiers (BadgeChipStyle, CardStyle, InteractiveStyle, SurfaceStyle) completed and archived
- ✅ Layer 2 Components (Badge, Card, KeyValueRow, SectionHeader) implemented with tests and previews
- ✅ Pattern unit/integration test infrastructure ready (Phase 3 tasks completed)
- ⬜ ToolbarPattern Apple platform QA pending (does not block BoxTreePattern logic)

## Test-First Plan
1. Create `FoundationUI/Tests/FoundationUITests/PatternsTests/BoxTreePatternTests.swift`
2. Model realistic ISO tree fixtures covering:
   - Deep nesting (≥5 levels)
   - Large data sets (1000+ nodes) for performance assertions
   - Accessibility scenarios (expanded/collapsed announcements)
3. Author failing unit tests for:
   - Expand/collapse state mutations
   - Selection propagation and callbacks
   - DS-driven indentation spacing
   - Keyboard navigation and accessibility identifiers
4. Extend integration tests if needed to compose BoxTreePattern with InspectorPattern once implementation exists.

## Implementation Outline (after tests fail)
1. Create `FoundationUI/Sources/FoundationUI/Patterns/BoxTreePattern.swift`
2. Define public API supporting:
   - Tree data source protocol/value semantics
   - Selection binding and optional multi-select
   - Expand/collapse with animation respecting `DS.Animation`
3. Apply DS tokens for spacing, typography, surface styling.
4. Optimize rendering using lazy containers for large data sets.
5. Provide SwiftUI previews (Light/Dark, iOS/iPadOS/macOS) and DocC documentation.

## Deliverables
- ✅ Tests file with comprehensive coverage and performance hooks
- ✅ Pattern implementation using DS tokens exclusively (no magic numbers)
- ✅ Preview catalog entries and DocC snippets
- ✅ Updated Task Plan status and archival entry upon completion

## Outcome
- Added `BoxTreeController` to orchestrate expand/collapse, selection, indentation, and accessibility announcements.
- Authored `BoxTreePattern` SwiftUI view composed with DS spacing, typography, radius, animation, and color tokens.
- Introduced design token scaffolding (spacing, colors, typography, animation, radius, opacity) with Linux-compatible fallbacks.
- Created unit tests covering expansion, selection policy, indentation math, accessibility strings, and 1000+ node performance scenarios.
- Established cross-platform observable compatibility wrappers enabling Linux builds without Combine.

## Notes
- Reuse existing `TreeNode` fixtures if available; otherwise, create fixtures under `Tests/SharedFixtures`
- Coordinate with ToolbarPattern QA once Apple runtime available to ensure pattern interactions remain stable
- Run `swift test` (and coverage) plus `swiftlint` before marking task complete
- Validate previews on Apple toolchains when available; ensure accessibility VoiceOver announcements verified with real hardware
