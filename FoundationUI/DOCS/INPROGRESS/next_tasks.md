## ðŸ”­ Upcoming Considerations
- Align all patterns with DS tokens to preserve zero magic number policy
- Extend preview catalog to include complex inspector workspaces

## âœ… Recently Completed
- InspectorPattern implementation (archived in `TASK_ARCHIVE/10_Phase3.1_InspectorPattern/`)

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- Continue updating `FoundationUI_TaskPlan.md` after each pattern lands
- Maintain â‰¥80% coverage for all new pattern modules
- Re-run `swift test` and `swift test --enable-code-coverage` after each milestone
