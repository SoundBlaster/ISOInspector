# Next Tasks for FoundationUI

**Updated**: 2025-10-25
**Current Focus**: Phase 3.1 â€“ UI Patterns (Layer 3) - 75% Complete

## ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Priorities

### ToolbarPattern Verification
- [ ] Validate layout with Dynamic Type, keyboard navigation, and reduced motion settings once SwiftUI runtime is available
- [ ] Capture platform preview snapshots (iOS, iPadOS, macOS) for documentation
- [ ] Re-run SwiftLint on macOS toolchain to confirm zero violations

### PatternPreviewCatalog Follow-up
- [ ] Run PatternPreviewCatalog previews on Apple simulators to verify layout and trait coverage
- [ ] Execute PatternPreviewCatalogTests on macOS once SwiftUI toolchain is accessible
- [ ] Capture catalog screenshots for documentation once previews render on Apple platforms

## ðŸ”­ Upcoming Considerations
- Align all patterns with DS tokens to preserve zero-magic-number policy
- Extend preview catalog to include complex inspector workspaces and toolbar configurations
- Prepare integration and snapshot smoke tests once remaining patterns are complete
