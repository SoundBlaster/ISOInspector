# FoundationUI Work Summary — 2025-10-25

## ✅ Completed
- Authored `PatternIntegrationTests` covering SidebarPattern ↔ InspectorPattern ↔ ToolbarPattern coordination.
- Added reusable `PatternIntegrationFixture` with DS token-driven content and accessibility hooks.
- Updated Task Plan progress to reflect completion of Phase 3 pattern integration tests.

## ⚠️ Outstanding / Blocked
- Platform snapshot validation pending macOS/iOS SwiftUI toolchains.
- `swift test` and `swiftlint` execution blocked by missing SwiftUI runtime and SwiftLint binary in container; rerun on Apple CI.

## 🔜 Next Steps
- Capture cross-platform snapshots once Apple toolchains are available.
- Archive Phase 3 integration task document after upstream verification.
