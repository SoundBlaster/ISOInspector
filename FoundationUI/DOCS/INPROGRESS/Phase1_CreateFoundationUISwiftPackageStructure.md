# Create FoundationUI Swift Package Structure

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Establish the dedicated FoundationUI Swift package scaffold so that future design token, modifier, and component work can compile and run inside ISOInspector's workspace.

## ðŸ§© Context
- **Phase**: 1.1 Project Setup & Infrastructure (Phase 1: Foundation)
- **Layer**: Infrastructure (Pre-Layer 0: Design Tokens)
- **Priority**: P0
- **Dependencies**: None

## âœ… Success Criteria
- [x] `Package.swift` updated with a `FoundationUI` library target and corresponding test target
- [x] Source and test directories created (`Sources/FoundationUI`, `Tests/FoundationUITests`)
- [x] Initial module structure compiles with `swift build`
- [x] SwiftPM resources (if any) scoped to FoundationUI only
- [x] Workspace documentation references new package location

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Notes
- Follow the Task Plan guidance to keep FoundationUI isolated from ISOInspectorKit runtime code until integration tasks begin.
- Mirror existing ISOInspector package conventions for toolchain compatibility (Swift 5.9+, supported platforms iOS 17+, iPadOS 17+, macOS 14+).
- Pre-create layer folders (`DesignTokens`, `Modifiers`, `Components`, `Patterns`, `Contexts`) to align with Composable Clarity architecture.
- Initialize placeholder files (`.gitkeep`) where needed to ensure directories track in Git.
- Prepare empty XCTest case files so the test target compiles before feature tests are written.

### Files to Create/Modify
- `Package.swift`
- `Sources/FoundationUI/DesignTokens/.gitkeep`
- `Sources/FoundationUI/Modifiers/.gitkeep`
- `Sources/FoundationUI/Components/.gitkeep`
- `Sources/FoundationUI/Patterns/.gitkeep`
- `Sources/FoundationUI/Contexts/.gitkeep`
- `Tests/FoundationUITests/DesignTokensTests/.gitkeep`
- `Tests/FoundationUITests/ModifiersTests/.gitkeep`
- `Tests/FoundationUITests/ComponentsTests/.gitkeep`
- `Tests/FoundationUITests/PatternsTests/.gitkeep`
- `Tests/FoundationUITests/ContextsTests/.gitkeep`
- `Tests/FoundationUITests/FoundationUIPackageConfigurationTests.swift`
- `Sources/FoundationUI/FoundationUI.swift`

### Design Token Usage
- Not applicable for this setup task; future implementation tasks must rely on DS tokens exclusively.
