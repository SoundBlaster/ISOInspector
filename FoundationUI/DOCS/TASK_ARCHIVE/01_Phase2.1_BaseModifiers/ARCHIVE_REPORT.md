## Next Tasks Identified

The following tasks have been identified for Phase 2.2 and documented in `INPROGRESS/next_tasks.md`:

### Immediate Priority (Phase 2.2 - Layer 2: Essential Components)

1. **Badge Component** (P0, S: 2-4 hours)
   - Status: Ready to start
   - Dependencies: BadgeChipStyle modifier ✅ COMPLETE
   - File: `Sources/FoundationUI/Components/Badge.swift`

2. **Card Component** (P0, M: 4-6 hours)
   - Status: Ready to start
   - Dependencies: CardStyle modifier ✅ COMPLETE
   - File: `Sources/FoundationUI/Components/Card.swift`

3. **KeyValueRow Component** (P0, M: 4-6 hours)
   - Status: Ready to start
   - Dependencies: DS.Typography ✅, DS.Spacing ✅
   - File: `Sources/FoundationUI/Components/KeyValueRow.swift`

4. **SectionHeader Component** (P0, S: 2-4 hours)
   - Status: Ready to start
   - Dependencies: DS.Typography ✅, DS.Spacing ✅
   - File: `Sources/FoundationUI/Components/SectionHeader.swift`

### Testing Tasks (Phase 2.2)
5. Component unit tests
6. Component snapshot tests
7. Component previews
8. Component accessibility tests
9. Component performance tests
10. Component integration tests
11. Code quality verification

### Demo Application (Phase 2.3)
12. Minimal demo app for component testing

**Recommended Start**: Badge component (simplest, validates component architecture)

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **TDD Workflow**: Writing tests first clarified requirements and caught edge cases early in the implementation process
2. **Design Token Discipline**: Strict zero magic numbers policy made code more maintainable and consistent
3. **Preview Coverage**: 20 comprehensive previews provide excellent visual documentation and QA
4. **Platform Adaptation**: Conditional compilation (`#if os(macOS)`) worked smoothly for handling platform differences
5. **Accessibility Integration**: Building accessibility from the start was far easier than retrofitting

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Swift Availability**: Tests can't run in Linux CI environment, but code compiles correctly for all target platforms
2. **Material Fallbacks**: Needed careful handling for Reduce Transparency accessibility setting with proper fallback colors
3. **Focus Indicators**: Platform differences in keyboard navigation required `@FocusState` management and conditional rendering
4. **Animation Timing**: Balanced responsiveness (quick user feedback) with smoothness (visual polish) using DS.Animation.quick

### Best Practices Established
1. **One Modifier = One File**: Clear separation of concerns makes codebase navigable
2. **Tests Mirror Implementation**: Test file structure matches source file organization
3. **Preview Diversity**: Show all variants + real-world combinations in previews
4. **DocC Examples**: Every public API has at least one usage example
5. **Accessibility Labels**: All semantic variants have descriptive VoiceOver labels

### Insights for Future Phases
- Continue strict TDD workflow for components (Phase 2.2)
- Maintain 100% DocC coverage from the start
- Create comprehensive previews as implementation progresses
- Use Design System tokens exclusively (zero exceptions)
- Build accessibility features in parallel with main implementation

## Open Questions

### Resolved
- ✅ **Question**: Should we support custom badge colors beyond semantic levels?
  - **Answer**: No, stick to semantic levels (info, warning, error, success) for consistency

- ✅ **Question**: How should we handle material fallbacks on unsupported platforms?
  - **Answer**: Use DS.Color.tertiary with appropriate opacity for graceful degradation

### For Future Phases
- **Question**: Should CopyableText be integrated into KeyValueRow in Phase 2.2 or deferred to Phase 4.2?
  - **Recommendation**: Implement basic KeyValueRow in Phase 2.2, add CopyableText integration in Phase 4.2

- **Question**: Do we need visual regression testing beyond snapshot tests?
  - **Recommendation**: Evaluate Percy or similar service in Phase 5 (QA)

- **Question**: Should we create a component playground app separate from the demo app?
  - **Recommendation**: Yes, in Phase 6.1 after main components are stable
