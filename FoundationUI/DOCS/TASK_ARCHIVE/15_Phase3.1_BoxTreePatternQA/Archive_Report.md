# Archive Report: Phase3.1_BoxTreePatternQA

## Summary
Archived the Phase 3.1 pattern workflow snapshot on 2025-10-25 after delivering the BoxTreePattern implementation and documenting outstanding ToolbarPattern verification work. This cycle captures the `next_tasks.md` state prior to selecting the next focus item.

## What Was Archived
- 1 planning document (`next_tasks.md`) detailing immediate verification tasks and recently completed pattern milestones.

## Archive Location
`FoundationUI/DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/15_Phase3.1_BoxTreePatternQA/`

## Task Plan Updates
- Confirmed BoxTreePattern task marked complete with QA archive reference in `FoundationUI_TaskPlan.md` (Phase 3.1 now 6/8 tasks complete).
- No additional task counters changed during this archival pass.

## Test Coverage
- Unit tests: `swift test` (354 tests executed, 0 failures, 1 skipped) — validates Linux pipeline health prior to archival.
- Coverage tooling pending: `swift test --enable-code-coverage` deferred to macOS environment with Xcode instrumentation.

## Quality Metrics
- SwiftLint: Pending — command unavailable on Linux runner; rerun scheduled on macOS toolchain.
- Magic Numbers: 0 (policy reaffirmed in pattern documentation).
- Accessibility: Dynamic Type, reduced motion, and keyboard navigation verification queued for Apple platforms.

## Next Tasks Identified
- Validate ToolbarPattern layout with Dynamic Type, keyboard navigation, and reduced motion settings once SwiftUI runtime is available.
- Capture ToolbarPattern preview snapshots across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS for documentation.
- Re-run SwiftLint on macOS toolchain to confirm zero violations.

## Lessons Learned
- Preserve `next_tasks` history in the archive to maintain continuity between development and QA cycles.
- Document platform-specific validation gaps when tooling (SwiftUI previews, SwiftLint) is unavailable on Linux.

## Open Questions
- What is the earliest opportunity to access a macOS SwiftUI runtime to complete ToolbarPattern verification?
- Can CI add a macOS SwiftLint stage to unblock outstanding workflow gates?
