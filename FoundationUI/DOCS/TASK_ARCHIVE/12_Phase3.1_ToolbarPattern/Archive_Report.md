# Archive Report: Phase3.1_ToolbarPattern

## Summary
Archived ToolbarPattern documentation, summary notes, and backlog artifacts for FoundationUI Phase 3.1 on 2025-10-25 after verifying regression tests and task-plan updates.

## What Was Archived
- 1 task document (`Phase3.1_ToolbarPattern.md`)
- 1 implementation summary (`Summary_of_Work.md`)
- 1 backlog snapshot (`next_tasks.md`)

## Archive Location
`FoundationUI/DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/12_Phase3.1_ToolbarPattern/`

## Task Plan Updates
- Marked ToolbarPattern task complete in `FoundationUI_TaskPlan.md`
- Increased Phase 3 progress to 4/16 tasks (25%) and Layer 3 progress to 4/8 tasks (50%)
- Updated overall completion counter to 25/111 tasks (23%)

## Test Coverage
- `swift test` (Linux): 347 tests executed, 0 failures, 1 skipped (Combine unavailable)
- `swift test --enable-code-coverage` (Linux): 347 tests executed, 0 failures, 1 skipped; coverage instrumentation emitted
- `swift build` (Linux): succeeded for package integrity

## Quality Metrics
- SwiftLint: Pending (requires macOS toolchain; tracked in recreated `next_tasks.md`)
- Magic numbers: None (ToolbarPattern uses DS tokens per design notes)
- Accessibility: VoiceOver labels, hints, and keyboard shortcut metadata recorded for all toolbar items

## Next Tasks Identified
- Validate ToolbarPattern on Apple simulators (Dynamic Type, reduced motion, SwiftLint)
- Implement BoxTreePattern with performance instrumentation
- Expand pattern integration and snapshot coverage once Apple toolchain access is restored

## Lessons Learned
- Shared toolbar item models reduce duplication while enabling platform-specific layout adjustments
- Capturing keyboard shortcut metadata alongside accessibility notes improves documentation hand-off
- Running full regression suites before archiving keeps Linux CI as a reliable safety net for future iterations

## Open Questions
- What adjustments are needed for toolbar overflow behaviour on macOS compact window sizes?
- Which snapshot tooling will be prioritized once SwiftUI previews are available again?
