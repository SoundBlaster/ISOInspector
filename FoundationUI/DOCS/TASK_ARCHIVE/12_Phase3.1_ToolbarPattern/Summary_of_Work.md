# Summary of Work â€“ ToolbarPattern Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-24

## Completed
- Implemented `ToolbarPattern` with adaptive layout resolver, overflow menu support, and DS token usage.
- Added keyboard shortcut metadata handling with accessibility label surfacing and helper tests.
- Authored `ToolbarPatternTests` covering item grouping, shortcut labelling, and layout resolver behaviour.
- Updated FoundationUI task tracking documents to mark ToolbarPattern deliverables complete and refreshed next-task checklist.

## Testing
- `swift test` *(fails on Linux: SwiftUI framework unavailable; ToolbarPattern and existing components require Apple toolchain)*

## Follow-Up
- Validate ToolbarPattern interaction/preview states on macOS/iOS once SwiftUI toolchain is available.
- Capture snapshot and accessibility tests leveraging Apple-specific frameworks after toolchain access is restored.
- Complete dynamic type and reduced motion validation pending real device simulators.
