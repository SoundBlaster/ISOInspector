# Archive Report: Phase3.1 PatternPreviewCatalog

## Summary
Archived completed documentation and planning artifacts for the FoundationUI Pattern Preview Catalog on 2025-10-25 to preserve implementation knowledge and maintain project continuity.

## What Was Archived
- 1 task document
- 0 implementation files
- 0 test files
- 1 next task snapshot

## Archive Location
`FoundationUI/DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/18_Phase3.1_PatternPreviewCatalog/`

## Task Plan Updates
- Confirmed Pattern Preview Catalog task remains marked complete with archive reference updated to folder `18_Phase3.1_PatternPreviewCatalog`
- Phase 3.1 progress unchanged at 7/8 tasks pending performance optimization follow-up
- Overall tracker remains at 31/111 tasks (28%) while documentation references latest archive location

## Test Coverage
- Unit tests: 354 tests executed via `swift test` (0 failures, 1 skipped)
- Snapshot tests: Included in suite results; no regressions detected
- Accessibility tests: Covered by existing XCTest cases; no new assertions required for documentation update

## Quality Metrics
- SwiftLint violations: Unable to verify in Linux container (binary unavailable)
- Magic numbers: Documentation affirms DS token usage policy (no violations noted)
- DocC coverage: Not impacted by archival; existing documentation remains authoritative

## Next Tasks Identified
- Validate ToolbarPattern layout with Dynamic Type, keyboard navigation, and reduced motion once SwiftUI runtime access is available
- Capture platform-specific preview snapshots (iOS, iPadOS, macOS) for documentation parity
- Re-run SwiftLint on macOS toolchain to confirm zero violations post-preview QA

## Lessons Learned
- Archiving documentation alongside next task snapshots maintains clarity on pending platform QA work
- Running the full Linux test suite before archival provides confidence that upstream integrations remain stable

## Open Questions
- When will Apple platform tooling be available to unblock ToolbarPattern verification and SwiftLint execution?
