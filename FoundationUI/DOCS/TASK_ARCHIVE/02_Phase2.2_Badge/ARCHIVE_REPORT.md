## Next Tasks Identified

### Immediate Priority (Phase 2.2)
1. **SectionHeader Component** (Recommended next)
   - Priority: P0
   - Estimated effort: S (2-4 hours)
   - Simple component, needed for patterns
   - No complex dependencies

2. **Card Component**
   - Priority: P0
   - Estimated effort: M (4-6 hours)
   - More complex, heavily reused
   - Depends on CardStyle modifier ✅

3. **KeyValueRow Component**
   - Priority: P0
   - Estimated effort: M (4-6 hours)
   - Essential for inspector patterns
   - No blocking dependencies

### Testing Tasks (Phase 2.2)
- Component Unit Tests (continue with remaining components)
- Component Snapshot Tests (setup and implementation)
- Component Accessibility Tests
- Component Performance Tests
- Component Integration Tests
- Code Quality Verification
- Demo Application (after all components complete)

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **TDD Approach**: Writing 15 tests before implementation clarified requirements and ensured comprehensive coverage
2. **Design System Tokens**: Zero magic numbers policy made code maintainable and consistent
3. **Component Composition**: Reusing existing BadgeLevel enum and BadgeChipStyle modifier kept implementation simple
4. **Documentation**: Complete DocC comments made component self-documenting
5. **Accessibility First**: Building VoiceOver support from the start was seamless

### Best Practices Demonstrated
1. **Outside-In TDD**: Tests → Implementation → Refactor → Document workflow
2. **Single Responsibility**: Badge has one clear purpose - display status with semantic colors
3. **Composability**: Badge composes with existing modifiers (BadgeChipStyle)
4. **Accessibility Integration**: VoiceOver support built-in from the start
5. **Platform Adaptation**: Previews demonstrate cross-platform compatibility

### Technical Decisions
1. **Reuse of BadgeLevel Enum**: Used existing enum from BadgeChipStyle.swift to avoid duplication
2. **Component Simplicity**: Badge is implemented as a thin wrapper around Text + badgeChipStyle
3. **Optional Icon Parameter**: Added `showIcon` parameter for flexibility while maintaining simple default behavior

## Open Questions

### For Next Component (SectionHeader)
- Should SectionHeader support custom divider styles beyond the default?
- Should divider be configurable in color/thickness, or fixed to DS tokens?
- Should SectionHeader support trailing accessories (e.g., button, badge)?

### For Phase 2.2 Completion
- When should we set up SnapshotTesting framework? (Before or after all components are implemented?)
- Should we create demo app incrementally as components are completed, or wait until all 4 are done?

### For Future Phases
- Will agents need custom Badge variants beyond the 4 semantic levels?
- Should Badge support custom colors outside of semantic levels for agent-generated UIs?
