# Archive Report: 10_Phase3.1_InspectorPattern

## Summary
Archived completed InspectorPattern workflow for FoundationUI Phase 3.1 on 2025-10-24. This archive captures the planning, implementation notes, verification summary, and follow-up tasks that transition FoundationUI into the Layer 3 pattern workstream.

---

## What Was Archived

### Task & Planning Documents (4 files)
1. **Phase3.1_InspectorPattern.md** – End-to-end task brief, success criteria, and implementation checklist for the InspectorPattern feature.
2. **Phase2.3_DemoApplication.md** – Final specification for the Phase 2.3 demo application (kept for historical context as the pattern work builds on the demo app).
3. **Summary_of_Work.md** – Session notes describing the InspectorPattern coding and verification activities executed on 2025-10-23.
4. **next_tasks.md** – Snapshot of outstanding UI Pattern tasks prior to archival (InspectorPattern now complete).

### Verification Evidence
- `swift test` (345 tests, 0 failures, 1 skipped)
- `swift test --enable-code-coverage` (345 tests, 0 failures, 1 skipped)
- `swiftlint` (tool unavailable in container – manual rule adherence confirmed through Code Quality guidelines)

### Total Archive Size
- **Files**: 4 documentation artifacts
- **Context**: 1,000+ lines of design notes, success criteria, and quality follow-up guidance

---

## Task Plan Updates
- Marked **Phase 3.1 – Implement InspectorPattern** as completed with QA status updated to reflect passing Linux verification (Apple platform validation still pending external testing).
- Updated Phase 3 progress counters and overall task totals.

---

## Quality Metrics
- ✅ **Unit & Integration Tests**: All InspectorPattern XCTest targets executed via `swift test`.
- ✅ **Code Coverage**: Rebuilt with coverage instrumentation (`swift test --enable-code-coverage`).
- ⚠️ **SwiftLint**: Binary not installed in container; compliance maintained per `.swiftlint.yml` and Code Quality audit from Phase 2.2.
- ✅ **Design Tokens**: Implementation validated to use `DS.Spacing`, `DS.Radius`, and `DS.Typography` tokens exclusively.
- ✅ **Accessibility**: Header applies `.accessibilityAddTraits(.isHeader)` and container exposes combined label for VoiceOver usage.
- ✅ **Previews**: InspectorPattern preview catalogue demonstrates metadata and status scenarios for documentation purposes.

## Lessons Learned
1. **Pattern Composition** – Leveraging previously archived Layer 2 components accelerates pattern assembly while preserving DS token fidelity.
2. **Cross-Platform Considerations** – Platform-aware padding logic (`platformPadding`) keeps inspector layouts consistent across macOS, iOS, and iPadOS.
3. **Quality Automation** – Running the full Linux test suite with coverage prior to archival provides confidence while awaiting platform-specific validation.
4. **Tool Availability** – Documenting the absence of SwiftLint in the CI container avoids regressions in future audits and ensures follow-up actions are visible.

---

## Follow-Up Actions
- Execute SwiftLint and platform UI verification on macOS/iOS development environments.
- Begin SidebarPattern implementation (highest priority task in the recreated `next_tasks.md`).
- Profile ScrollView performance once large editor flows are introduced (ties to existing `@todo` note within `InspectorPattern.swift`).
