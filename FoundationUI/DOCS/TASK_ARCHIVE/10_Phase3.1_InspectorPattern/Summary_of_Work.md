# Summary of Work â€“ 2025-10-24

## InspectorPattern Completion Highlights
- Finalized InspectorPattern layout combining fixed header and scrollable content with DS token-driven spacing, typography, and radii.
- Confirmed unit and integration tests covering initialization, material modifier, and component composition via `swift test`.
- Regenerated coverage artefacts with `swift test --enable-code-coverage` to validate Layer 3 regression protection.
- Documented preview catalogue scenarios for metadata and status dashboards to support DocC and demo applications.
- Preserved Phase 2.3 Demo Application specification alongside pattern docs for historical continuity.

## Outstanding Follow-Up
- Run SwiftLint on macOS tooling to capture any style regressions (binary unavailable in Linux container).
- Exercise previews and interactive scrolling on Apple platforms to validate material rendering and Dynamic Type behaviour.
- Profile large inspector payloads once editor workflows introduce real-world data volumes.
