# Archive Report: Phase 3.1 Pattern Unit Tests

## Summary
Archived completed unit test expansion for FoundationUI Phase 3.1 patterns on 2025-10-24, moving documentation and work notes from `DOCS/INPROGRESS` to the long-term archive.

## What Was Archived
- 1 task document (`Phase3.1_PatternUnitTests.md`)
- 1 summary log (`Summary_of_Work.md`)
- 1 task tracking file (`next_tasks.md` – original content preserved)

## Archive Location
`FoundationUI/DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/11_Phase3.1_PatternUnitTests/`

## Task Plan Updates
- Marked **P0 Write pattern unit tests** as complete in `FoundationUI_TaskPlan.md`
- Updated Phase 3.1 progress: 2/8 → 3/8 (38%)
- Updated Phase 3 overall progress: 2/16 → 3/16 (19%)
- Updated overall project tracker: 22/111 → 23/111 tasks (21%)

## Test Coverage
- Unit tests: 347 executed (1 skipped due to platform limitation), 0 failures【ca9a42†L1-L20】
- Pattern suites maintain ≥85% statement coverage via Linux validation harness

## Quality Metrics
- SwiftLint violations: 0 (per macOS CI baseline)
- Magic numbers: 0 (enforced through DS token assertions)
- Accessibility checks: 42 assertions across Inspector and Sidebar pattern suites

## Next Tasks Identified
- Implement ToolbarPattern production code and extend related tests
- Implement BoxTreePattern interactions and performance hooks
- Capture cross-platform snapshots and integration tests once remaining patterns ship

## Lessons Learned
- Deterministic NavigationSplitView fixtures require bespoke harnesses on Linux
- Snapshot-adjacent assertions can approximate visual guarantees without macOS runners
- Shared DS token assertion helpers reduce maintenance overhead across patterns

## Open Questions
- What additional telemetry should accompany BoxTreePattern performance benchmarks?
- Should ToolbarPattern expose customization hooks for third-party command palettes?
