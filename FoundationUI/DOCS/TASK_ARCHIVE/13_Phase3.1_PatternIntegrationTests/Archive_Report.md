# Archive Report: Phase 3.1 Pattern Integration Tests

## Summary
Archived completed work from FoundationUI Phase 3.1 pattern integration effort on 2025-10-25. Transitioned documentation and workflow notes from INPROGRESS to the permanent archive after validating integration coverage and updating project trackers.

## What Was Archived
- 2 task documents (`Phase3_PatternIntegrationTests.md`, `Summary_of_Work.md`)
- 1 planning file (`next_tasks.md`)

## Archive Location
`FoundationUI/DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/13_Phase3.1_PatternIntegrationTests/`

## Task Plan Updates
- Marked "Create pattern integration tests" as complete in Phase 3.1 task list.
- Updated Phase 3 progress: 4/16 (25%) → 5/16 (31%).
- Updated overall project progress: 26/111 (23%) → 27/111 (24%).

## Test Coverage
- Unit & integration tests: `swift test` (349 executed, 0 failures, 1 skipped Combine benchmark).
- Code coverage: `swift test --enable-code-coverage` executed on Linux; export of coverage reports pending Apple toolchain tooling.
- Accessibility & snapshot validation: Pending Apple platform tooling.

## Quality Metrics
- SwiftLint violations: ⚠️ Pending — SwiftLint binary unavailable in Linux container; rerun on macOS CI.
- Magic numbers: 0 (verified DS token usage in integration fixtures).
- DocC coverage: Integration doc updates staged for publication.

## Next Tasks Identified
- ToolbarPattern verification on Apple platforms (Dynamic Type, keyboard navigation, reduced motion).
- BoxTreePattern implementation and performance benchmarking.
- Extend preview catalog to cover complex inspector workspaces and toolbar configurations.

## Lessons Learned
- Maintaining reusable fixtures streamlines multi-pattern integration tests.
- Running the full SwiftPM test suite on Linux provides confidence even when SwiftUI previews are unavailable.
- Capturing pending Apple-specific QA tasks in `next_tasks.md` keeps follow-up work visible post-archive.

## Open Questions
- When will SwiftUI preview validation be available in CI for Apple platforms?
- Should performance benchmarks integrate with existing LargeFile fixtures or spin off dedicated pattern datasets?
