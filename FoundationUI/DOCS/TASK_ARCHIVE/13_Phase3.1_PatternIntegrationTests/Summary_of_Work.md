# FoundationUI Work Summary — 2025-10-25

## ✅ Completed
- Authored `PatternIntegrationTests` covering SidebarPattern ↔ InspectorPattern ↔ ToolbarPattern coordination.
- Added reusable `PatternIntegrationFixture` with DS token-driven content and accessibility hooks.
- Executed `swift test` on Linux (349 tests, 0 failures, 1 skipped Combine benchmark) to confirm integration stability.
- Updated Task Plan progress to reflect completion of Phase 3 pattern integration tests.

## ⚠️ Outstanding / Blocked
- Platform snapshot validation pending macOS/iOS SwiftUI toolchains.
- SwiftLint verification pending — binary unavailable in Linux container; rerun on macOS CI once tooling restored.

## 🔜 Next Steps
- Capture cross-platform snapshots once Apple toolchains are available.
- Rerun SwiftLint and coverage commands on Apple CI to finalize QA sign-off.
