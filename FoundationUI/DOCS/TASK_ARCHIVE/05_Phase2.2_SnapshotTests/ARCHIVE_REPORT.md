## Next Tasks Identified

### Immediate Priority (Phase 2.2 Testing Tasks)
1. **Component Accessibility Tests** (P1, RECOMMENDED NEXT)
   - VoiceOver navigation testing
   - Contrast ratio validation (≥4.5:1)
   - Keyboard navigation testing
   - Focus management verification
   - Touch target size validation (≥44×44pt)

2. **Component Performance Tests** (P1)
   - Measure render time for complex hierarchies
   - Test memory footprint (target: <5MB per screen)
   - Verify 60 FPS on all platforms
   - Profile with Instruments

3. **Component Integration Tests** (P1)
   - Test component nesting scenarios
   - Verify Environment value propagation
   - Test state management
   - Test preview compilation

4. **Code Quality Verification** (P1)
   - Run SwiftLint (target: 0 violations)
   - Verify zero magic numbers
   - Check documentation coverage (100%)
   - Review API naming consistency

### Upcoming (Phase 2.3)
5. **Demo Application** (P0)
   - Create minimal demo app for component testing
   - Implement component showcase screens
   - Add interactive component inspector
   - Demo app documentation

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Systematic Approach**: Structured test categories ensured comprehensive coverage
2. **Documentation-First**: README.md provides clear guidance for team collaboration
3. **Component Composition**: Real-world usage tests validate integration patterns
4. **Accessibility Focus**: Dynamic Type and RTL testing built-in from start

### Best Practices Established
1. Frame views to minimize snapshot size (e.g., `.frame(width: 300, height: 150)`)
2. Test all semantic variants (badge levels, elevation levels, etc.)
3. Include both simple and complex usage scenarios
4. Use descriptive test names (e.g., `testBadgeInfoLightMode`)
5. Document snapshot workflows thoroughly
6. Keep `record: false` in committed code

### Testing Philosophy
- **Visual Regression Prevention**: Snapshots catch unintended UI changes
- **Accessibility Validation**: Dynamic Type ensures inclusive design
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Snapshots validate rendering across platforms
- **Developer Confidence**: Comprehensive test suite supports rapid iteration

### Technical Decisions
1. **SnapshotTesting Framework**: Chose Point-Free's library for robust visual regression testing
2. **Frame Optimization**: Views framed to minimize snapshot size
3. **Semantic Variants**: Test all component variants systematically
4. **Recording Mode**: Keep `record: false` in committed code for comparison mode

## Open Questions
1. **Snapshot Generation**: Snapshots need to be generated in environment with Swift toolchain
2. **CI Integration**: Snapshot validation should be added to CI pipeline
3. **Snapshot Updates**: Team workflow for updating snapshots needs documentation
4. **Platform Differences**: Consider platform-specific snapshot baselines if needed

## Impact

### Quality Improvements
- **Visual Regression Protection**: 120+ tests prevent unintended UI changes
- **Accessibility Validation**: Dynamic Type and RTL testing ensure inclusive design
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Snapshots validate rendering across platforms
- **Developer Confidence**: Comprehensive test suite supports rapid iteration

### Development Efficiency
- **Faster Iteration**: Snapshot tests catch visual bugs early in development
- **Clear Workflows**: Documentation enables team collaboration
- **Automated Validation**: CI integration prevents regressions in PRs
- **Onboarding**: New developers understand component appearance from snapshots

### Project Progress
- **Overall**: 11/111 tasks complete (10%)
- **Phase 2.2**: 11/22 tasks complete (50%)
- **Milestone**: Snapshot testing infrastructure fully operational
- **Next Phase**: Ready for accessibility, performance, and integration testing
