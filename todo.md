# TODO

- [x] #D3 Parse `tfdt` and `trun` boxes plus aggregate `traf` container metadata so fragment runs expose sample timing and offsets. _(Completed — see DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/137_D3_traf_tfhd_tfdt_trun_Parsing/Summary_of_Work.md for implementation recap.)_
- [x] #D5 Parse `mfra/tfra/mfro` random access boxes so fragment index metadata flows through ISOInspectorKit, CLI summaries, and JSON exports. _(Completed — see DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/140_D5_mfra_tfra_mfro_Random_Access/Summary_of_Work.md for current iteration notes.)_
- [x] #D6B Surface sample encryption helper metadata across JSON exports, CLI formatting, and app detail views. _(Completed — see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/150_Summary_of_Work_2025-10-22_Sample_Encryption_Metadata/Summary_of_Work.md` for final regression coverage.)_
- [x] #T1.1 Define `ParseIssue` model with severity, code, message, and byte range support for tolerant parsing. _(Completed — see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/164_Summary_of_Work_ParseIssue_Model/Summary_of_Work.md` for implementation recap.)_
- [x] #T1.2 Extend `ParseTreeNode` with issues and status fields so tolerant parsing metadata flows through JSON exports and UI detail views. _(Completed — see `DOCS/INPROGRESS/Summary_of_Work.md` for the current iteration recap.)_
