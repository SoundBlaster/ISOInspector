# TODO

- [x] #D3 Parse `tfdt` and `trun` boxes plus aggregate `traf` container metadata so fragment runs expose sample timing and offsets. _(Completed — see DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/137_D3_traf_tfhd_tfdt_trun_Parsing/Summary_of_Work.md for implementation recap.)_
- [x] #D5 Parse `mfra/tfra/mfro` random access boxes so fragment index metadata flows through ISOInspectorKit, CLI summaries, and JSON exports. _(Completed — see DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/140_D5_mfra_tfra_mfro_Random_Access/Summary_of_Work.md for current iteration notes.)_
- [x] #D6B Surface sample encryption helper metadata across JSON exports, CLI formatting, and app detail views. _(Completed — see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/150_Summary_of_Work_2025-10-22_Sample_Encryption_Metadata/Summary_of_Work.md` for final regression coverage.)_
- [x] #T1.1 Define `ParseIssue` model with severity, code, message, and byte range support for tolerant parsing. _(Completed — see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/164_Summary_of_Work_ParseIssue_Model/Summary_of_Work.md` for implementation recap.)_
- [x] #T1.2 Extend `ParseTreeNode` with issues and status fields so tolerant parsing metadata flows through JSON exports and UI detail views. _(Completed — see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/165_T1_2_Extend_ParseTreeNode_Status_and_Issues/Summary_of_Work.md` for the current iteration recap.)_
- [x] #T1.3 Create `ParsePipeline.Options` with strict/tolerant presets and propagate defaults through CLI and app entry points. _(Completed — see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/166_T1_3_ParsePipeline_Options/Summary_of_Work.md` for verification notes.)_
- [x] #T1.4 Refactor `BoxHeaderDecoder` to return `Result<BoxHeader, BoxHeaderDecodingError>` instead of throwing. _(Completed — archived in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/167_T1_4_BoxHeaderDecoder_Result_API/Summary_of_Work.md` with downstream call site updates and regression coverage.)_
- [x] #T1.5 Propagate decoder failures through tolerant parsing and capture them as `ParseIssue` records without aborting traversal. _(Completed — see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/169_T1_5_Propagate_Decoder_Failures_Through_Tolerant_Parsing/Summary_of_Work.md` for implementation recap and verification notes.)_
- [x] #T1.7 Finalize traversal guard requirements, codifying depth and progress clamps for tolerant parsing. _(Completed — see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/172_Summary_of_Work_2025-10-26/Summary_of_Work.md` and `DOCS/AI/Tolerance_Parsing/Traversal_Guard_Requirements.md` for the guard specification and follow-up roadmap.)_
- [x] #T1.8 Implement traversal guard enforcement in the streaming pipeline, wiring guard diagnostics through tolerant parsing surfaces. _(Completed — see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/173_T1_8_Traversal_Guard_Implementation/Summary_of_Work.md` for implementation and verification details.)_
