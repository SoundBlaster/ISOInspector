# TODO

- [x] #1 Implement ParsePipeline.live() to iterate through MP4 boxes and emit streaming parse events.
- [x] #2 Automate refreshing MP4RABoxes.json from the upstream registry and document the update workflow.
- [ ] #3 Implement remaining validation rules (VR-001, VR-002, VR-004, VR-005) using streaming context and metadata stack.
    - [x] VR-001 Box size must be ≥ header length and fit within file range.
    - [x] VR-002 Container boxes must close exactly at their declared payload size.
    - [x] VR-004 `ftyp` must appear before any media box.
    - [x] VR-005 `moov` must precede `mdat` unless flagged streaming.
    - [x] VR-006 Research log persists unknown boxes for follow-up analysis.
- [x] #4 Integrate ResearchLogMonitor with SwiftUI previews once VR-006 UI surfaces consume research entries. **(Archived — see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/76_VR006_Preview_Audit_Integration/Summary_of_Work.md`.)**
- [x] #5 Emit telemetry during UI smoke tests to flag missing VR-006 research log events.
- [x] #6 Add box category and streaming metadata filters once corresponding models are available.
- [x] #7 Highlight field subranges and support selection syncing once payload annotations are available.
- [x] #8 Expand fixture catalog with fragmented, DASH, and malformed samples plus expected validation notes.
- [x] #9 Add CLI export commands for JSON and binary captures using the new ISOInspectorKit exporters.
- [x] #10 Replace JSON persistence with the selected CoreData schema once R6 finalizes annotation storage requirements.
- [x] #11 Implement session persistence (Task E3) following the archived CoreData migration plan. **(Completed — see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/52_E3_Session_Persistence/`.)**
- [x] #12 Add DocC publishing to CI once storage and hosting requirements are validated.
- [x] #13 Apply NestedA11yIDs identifiers to research log preview flows when promoted to production UI screens.
- [x] #14 Add NestedA11yIDs coverage for annotation note edit/save/delete controls once QA automation scenarios are defined.
- [x] PDD:45m Surface global logging and telemetry toggles once streaming metrics are exposed to the CLI.
- [x] PDD:1h Execute streaming inspection by consuming ParsePipeline events when Task D2 builds the streaming command.
- [x] PDD:1h Produce validation reports with streaming pipeline once Task D2 defines the CLI output contract.
- [x] PDD:45m Route export operations to streaming capture utilities as they migrate from ISOInspectorCLIRunner.
- [x] PDD:30m Surface document load failures in the app shell UI once design for error banners lands. **(Completed — see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/66_E5_Surface_Document_Load_Failures/Summary_of_Work.md`.)**
- [x] PDD:30m Surface recents persistence failures in diagnostics once logging pipeline is available. **(Completed — see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/68_E6_Emit_Persistence_Diagnostics/Summary_of_Work.md`.)**
- [x] PDD:30m Surface session persistence failures in diagnostics once logging pipeline is available. **(Completed — see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/68_E6_Emit_Persistence_Diagnostics/Summary_of_Work.md`.)**
- [x] PDD:1h Connect CoreData session bookmark diffs to persisted bookmark entities once reconciliation rules are defined. **(Completed — see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/77_C7_Connect_Bookmark_Diffs_to_Resolved_Bookmarks/Summary_of_Work.md`.)**
- [x] PDD:30m Evaluate whether automation via Apple Events is required for notarized builds and extend entitlements safely. *(Archived — see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/57_Distribution_Apple_Events_Notarization_Assessment/56_Distribution_Apple_Events_Notarization_Assessment.md`; outcome documented in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/57_Distribution_Apple_Events_Notarization_Assessment/57_Distribution_Apple_Events_Notarization_Assessment.md`.)*
- [x] Follow-up: Track outcome of the notarized build Apple Events automation assessment. **(Completed — see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/57_Distribution_Apple_Events_Notarization_Assessment/57_Distribution_Apple_Events_Notarization_Assessment.md` and the archived summary in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/79_Readme_Feature_Matrix_and_Distribution_Follow_Up/79_Distribution_Apple_Events_Follow_Up.md`.)**
- [x] PDD:1h Provide UIDocumentPicker integration for iOS/iPadOS once UIKit adapters are introduced. **(Completed — FilesystemAccess.live now bridges to UIDocumentPicker on UIKit platforms.)**
- [x] **Completed:** PDD:45m Wire BookmarkPersistenceStore into recents and session controllers so bookmark identifiers persist from a single source. See `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/70_Bookmark_Persistence_Schema/2025-10-16-bookmark-persistence-schema.md` and the archived implementation notes in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/71_G2_Persist_FilesystemAccessKit_Bookmarks/Summary_of_Work.md`.
- [x] PDD:30m Wire CLI bookmark flows to consume FilesystemAccessAuditTrail events once dedicated zero-trust telemetry flags land. **(Completed — see `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/78_PDD_30m_Wire_CLI_Bookmark_Flows/Summary_of_Work.md` and `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/78_PDD_30m_Wire_CLI_Bookmark_Flows/PDD_30m_Wire_CLI_Bookmark_Flows.md`.)**
- [x] PDD:45m Land the manually curated `AppIcon.icon` asset and retire the automation that generated `AppIcon.appiconset` raster outputs. _(Completed — app icon now checked in as a static resource, and the generator/test scaffolding was removed in favor of manual updates.)_
- [x] PDD:45m Wire generate_fixtures.py to ingest manifest-driven remote downloads, including checksum verification and license mirroring. (See `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/84_R2_Fixture_Acquisition/R2_Fixture_Acquisition.md`.) **(Completed — manifest workflow summarized in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/85_PDD_45m_Wire_Generate_Fixtures_Manifest/Summary_of_Work.md`.)**
- [x] PDD:30m Produce fixture storage README describing mount paths for macOS runners and Linux CI caches once infrastructure lands. (See `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/84_R2_Fixture_Acquisition/R2_Fixture_Acquisition.md`.) **(Completed — documented in `Documentation/FixtureCatalog/README.md` and archived in `DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/86_PDD_30m_Fixture_Storage_README/`.)**
