# TODO

- [x] #D3 Parse `tfdt` and `trun` boxes plus aggregate `traf` container metadata so fragment runs expose sample timing and offsets. _(Completed — see DOCS/TASK_ARCHIVE/137_D3_traf_tfhd_tfdt_trun_Parsing/Summary_of_Work.md for implementation recap.)_
- [x] #D5 Parse `mfra/tfra/mfro` random access boxes so fragment index metadata flows through ISOInspectorKit, CLI summaries, and JSON exports. _(Completed — see DOCS/INPROGRESS/Summary_of_Work.md for current iteration notes.)_
